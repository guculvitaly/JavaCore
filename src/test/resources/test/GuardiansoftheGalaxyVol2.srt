- Come on!
- Slow down!

12
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,231
This way, my river lily!
Come on!

13
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,489
Where are you taking me?

14
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,560
Come on, come on.

15
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,711
Look. Look!

16
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,876
Oh, it's beautiful!

17
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,031
I was afraid
it wouldn't take to the soil...

18
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,714
but it rooted quickly.

19
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:01,280
And soon...,
it'll be everywhere.

20
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,512
All across the universe.

21
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,971
Well, I don't know what
you're talking about...

22
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,632
but I like the way you say it.

23
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,479
My heart is yours...

24
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,192
Meredith Quill.

25
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,710
I can't believe I fell in love
with a spaceman.

26
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:13,576
Showtime, a-holes!

27
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,129
It will be here any minute.

28
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,952
Which will be its loss.

29
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,059
I thought your thing was a sword?

30
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,180
We've been hired to stop
an interdimensional beast...

31
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,920
from feeding on those batteries,
and I'm gonna stop it with a sword?

32
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,160
It's just, swords were your thing
and guns were mine.

33
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,919
But I guess we're both doing guns now.
I just didn't know that.

34
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:33,636
Drax, why aren't you wearing
one of Rocket's aero-rigs?

35
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,108
It hurts.

36
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,280
It hurts?

37
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,473
I have sensitive nipples.

38
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,519
"My nipples hurt!
Oh, goodness me!"

39
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,238
What about him? What's he doing?

40
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,754
I'm finishing this so we can listen
to tunes while we work.

41
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,148
How is that a priority?

42
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,675
Blame Quill. He's the one
who loves music so much.

43
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:53,432
No, I actually agree with Drax on this.

44
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,999
That's hardly important right now.

45
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:57,335
Oh, okay.
Sure, Quill.

46
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,513
No, seriously,
I side with Drax.

47
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,150
No, I understand that.
You're being very serious right now.

48
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,358
I can clearly see you winking.

49
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,751
Damn it. I'm using my left eye?

50
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,354
I am Groot.

51
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,520
They were not looking at you funny.

52
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:24,692
Well, that's intense.

53
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,400
Groot!

54
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,009
Groot, get out of the way!
You're gonna get hurt!

55
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,080
Hi.

56
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:31,895
No!
Spit it out!

57
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,109
Come on!

58
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,519
Disgusting!

59
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,033
The beast's hide is too thick
to be pierced from the outside.

60
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:44,232
I must cut through it from the inside.

61
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,520
Huh?

62
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:48,134
No, no!
Drax, wait a minute!

63
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,200
Drax!

64
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,099
What is he doing?

65
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:03,121
He said the skin is too thick
to be pierced from the outside, so he...

66
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,216
- That doesn't make any sense!
- I tried telling him that!

67
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,896
Skin is the same level of thickness
from the inside as from the outside!

68
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,478
I realize that.

69
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:15,490
There is a cut on its neck.

70
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,790
Rocket, get it to look up.

71
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,713
Hey, you giant Sea-Monkey! 
Up here!

72
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,179
Watch it, Quill!

73
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:22,531
Yes! 
I have single-handedly...

74
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:24,260
...vanquished the beast!

75
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,549
What?

76
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,713
What are they called again?

77
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,314
Anulax batteries.

78
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,035
Harbulary batteries.

79
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,509
That's nothing like what I just said.

80
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,480
But they're worth
thousands of units apiece...

81
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,560
which is why the Sovereign
hired us to protect them.

82
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:54,195
Careful what you say around these folks.
They're easily offended.

83
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,792
The cost of transgression is death.

84
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:01,479
We thank you, Guardians,
for putting your lives on the line.

85
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:05,633
We could not risk the lives
of our own Sovereign citizens.

86
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,234
Every citizen is born
exactly as designed by the community.

87
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:13,637
Impeccable,
both physically and mentally.

88
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:16,070
We control the DNA of our progeny...

89
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,355
germinating them in birthing pods.

90
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:22,150
I guess I prefer to make people
the old-fashioned way.

91
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,800
Perhaps someday,
you could give me a history lesson...

92
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:29,511
in the archaic ways of our ancestors.

93
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,671
For academic purposes.

94
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,757
I would be honored, yes.

95
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,911
In the name of research...

96
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:38,594
I think that could be pretty, uh...

97
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,034
repulsive.

98
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,440
I'm not into that kind of casual...

99
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,515
Oh, please.

100
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,990
Your people promised something
in exchange for our services.

101
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,134
Bring it...

102
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,838
and we shall gladly be on our way.

103
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,594
Family reunion. Yay.

104
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:09,194
I understand she is your sister.

105
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,558
She's worth no more to me
than the bounty due for her on Xandar.

106
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:18,192
Our soldiers apprehended her
attempting to steal the batteries.

107
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,117
Do with her as you please.

108
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,437
We thank you, High Priestess Ayesha.

109
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:29,400
What is your heritage, Mr. Quill?

110
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,079
My mother is from Earth.

111
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,158
And your father?

112
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,792
He ain't from Missouri. That's all I know.

113
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,279
I see it within you.

114
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:45,992
An unorthodox genealogy.

115
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:50,398
A hybrid that seems particularly...

116
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,959
reckless.

117
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:57,032
You know, they told me you people
were conceited douchebags...

118
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,070
but that isn't true at all.

119
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:05,900
Oh, shit.

120
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,856
I'm using my wrong eye again,
aren't I?

121
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:10,490
I'm sorry...
That was meant to be behind your back.

122
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,240
Count yourself blessed
they didn't kill you.

123
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,772
You're telling me.

124
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:18,035
You wanna buy some batteries?

125
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,588
<i>All right,
let's get baldy to Xandar</i>

126
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,113
<i>and collect that bounty.</i>

127
00:12:40,942 --> 00:12:44,982
<font color="#ffff00">Awesome Mix Vol.2</font>

128
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,396
That stuff about my father...

129
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,671
Who does she think she is?

130
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:33,149
I know you're sensitive about that.

131
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,520
I'm not sensitive about it.
I just don't know who he is.

132
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,078
Sorry if it seemed like
I was flirting with the High Priestess.

133
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,913
I wasn't.

134
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,190
I don't care if you were.

135
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,157
Well, I feel like you do care.

136
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:48,450
That's why I'm apologizing. So, sorry!

137
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,950
Gamora is not the one for you, Quill.

138
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:52,895
Damn shadow.

139
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:54,891
There are two types of beings
in the universe...

140
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:57,032
those who dance, and those who do not.

141
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,078
Mmm-hmm.

142
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,431
I first met my beloved at a war rally.

143
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,500
Oh, God.

144
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:05,413
Everyone in the village
flailed about, dancing.

145
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,238
Except one woman.

146
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,033
My Ovette.

147
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,876
I knew immediately
she was the one for me.

148
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,634
The most melodic song in the world
could be playing.

149
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,555
She wouldn't even tap her foot.

150
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,516
Wouldn't move a muscle.

151
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:23,399
One might assume she was dead.

152
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,959
That does sound pretty hot.

153
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:28,199
It would make
my nether regions engorge.

154
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,237
Okay. I get it, yes.

155
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,311
I'm a dancer, Gamora is not.

156
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,916
You just need to find a woman
who is pathetic... like you.

157
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,240
Mmm.

158
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:44,153
I'm hungry.
Hand me some of that yaro root.

159
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,793
No. It's not ripe yet...

160
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,995
and I hate you.

161
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,468
You hate me?

162
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:51,359
You left me there
while you stole that stone for yourself.

163
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,590
And yet here you stand, a hero.

164
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,553
I will be free of these shackles
soon enough, and I will kill you.

165
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,314
I swear.

166
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,595
No.

167
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,557
You're gonna live out
the rest of your days

168
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,153
in a prison on Xandar...

169
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,639
Wishing you could.

170
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:12,469
This is weird.

171
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:14,596
We've got a Sovereign fleet
approaching from the rear.

172
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:15,656
Why would they do that?

173
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,296
Probably because Rocket stole
some of their batteries.

174
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,520
Dude!

175
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,040
Right.

176
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,320
He didn't steal some of those.

177
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,641
I don't know why they're after us.
What a mystery this is.

178
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,191
What were you thinking?

179
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,736
Dude, they were really easy to steal!

180
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,193
- That's your defense?
- Come on!

181
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,635
You saw how that High Priestess
talked down to us.

182
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,518
Now I'm teaching her a lesson!

183
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,914
Oh, I didn't realize your motivation
was altruism.

184
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,576
It's really a shame the Sovereign
have mistaken your intentions...

185
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,280
- and they're trying to kill us.
- Exactly!

186
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,112
I was being sarcastic!

187
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,349
Oh, no!

188
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,696
You're supposed to use
a sarcastic voice!

189
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,755
Now I look foolish!

190
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,536
Can we put the bickering on hold...

191
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,596
until after we survive
this massive space battle?

192
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,518
- More incoming!
- Good!

193
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,159
I wanna kill some guys!

194
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,400
You're not killing anyone.

195
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,073
All those ships are remotely piloted.

196
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,600
Damn it!

197
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,151
What is the delay, Admiral?

198
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:36,393
High Priestess, the batteries,
they are exceptionally combustible...

199
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,856
and could destroy the entire fleet.

200
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,599
Our concern is their slight
against our people.

201
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:44,437
We hired them and they steal from us.

202
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:46,920
It is heresy of the highest order.

203
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,911
<i>All command modules...</i>

204
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,674
<i>fire with the intent to kill.</i>

205
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,798
What's the nearest habitable planet?

206
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,153
It's called Berhert.

207
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,038
- How many jumps?
- Only one.

208
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,192
But the access point is 47 clicks away.

209
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:15,193
And you have to go through
that quantum asteroid field.

210
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,040
Quill, to make it through that...

211
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,816
you'd have to be the greatest
pilot in the universe.

212
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,075
Lucky for us,

213
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,473
- I...
- I am.

214
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,196
What are you doing?

215
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,320
I've been flying this rig
since I was 10 years old.

216
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,392
I was cybernetically engineered
to pilot a spacecraft.

217
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:52,313
You were cybernetically engineered
to be a douchebag!

218
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,340
Stop it.

219
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,716
Quill, later on tonight,
you're gonna be laying down in your bed...

220
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,976
and there's gonna be something squishy
in your pillow case.

221
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,316
And you're gonna be like, "What's this?"

222
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:01,220
And it's gonna be,
because I put a turd in there!

223
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,070
You put your turd in my bed,
I shave you.

224
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,799
Oh, it won't be my turd.

225
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,313
It will be Drax's.

226
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,632
I have famously huge turds.

227
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:15,514
We're about to die,
and this is what we're discussing?

228
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Son of a...

229
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,599
Dude! Seriously!

230
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,200
Hey! Let me...

231
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,914
Idiots!

232
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,160
Well, that's what you get

233
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,633
when Quill flies.

234
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:42,273
Ow!

235
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,715
We still have a Sovereign craft
behind us.

236
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,471
Our weapons are down.

237
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,710
20 clicks to the jump!

238
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,720
Hold on.

239
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,116
It's not ripe.

240
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:18,190
Come on, Zylak. You can do this.

241
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,392
Yes!

242
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,591
15 clicks to the jump!

243
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,195
Come on!

244
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,479
Keep going!

245
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,915
10 clicks!

246
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,318
Die, spaceship!

247
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,394
You suck, Zylak.

248
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,595
Typical.

249
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,280
Five clicks!

250
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,633
Son of a...

251
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,911
They went around the field!

252
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,875
Someone destroyed all our ships!

253
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,068
What?

254
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,557
Who?

255
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,033
One click!

256
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,897
- What is that?
- Who cares?

257
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,234
That's the jump point! Go!

258
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,918
It's a guy.

259
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:54,970
Oh, my God.

260
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,473
He's still out there?

261
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:25,790
Groot, put your seatbelt on!

262
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,875
Prepare for a really bad landing!

263
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,516
That was awesome!

264
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,109
Yes!

265
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,354
Look at this!

266
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,712
Where is the other half of our ship?

267
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:20,880
My ship.

268
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,949
Either one of you could have
gotten us through that field...

269
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:25,736
had you flown with
what's between your ears

270
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,239
instead of what's between your legs!

271
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,153
If what's between my legs
had a hand on it...

272
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,436
I guarantee I could have landed
this ship with it.

273
00:22:33,439 --> 00:22:34,296
Peter.

274
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,400
We almost died
because of your arrogance.

275
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,080
More like because he stole...

276
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:39,409
The Anulax batteries!

277
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,755
They're called Harbulary batteries.

278
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,552
No, they're not!

279
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:45,292
Do you know why I did it,
Star-Munch?

280
00:22:45,856 --> 00:22:46,356
Hmm?

281
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,780
I'm not gonna answer to "Star-Munch."

282
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,711
I did it because I wanted to!

283
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:50,517
Dick.

284
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,397
What are we even talking about this for?

285
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:55,228
We just had a little man save us
by blowing up 50 ships!

286
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,400
How little?

287
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,635
Well, I don't know, like this?

288
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:00,378
A little one-inch man saved us?

289
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,880
Well, if he got closer,
I'm sure he would be much larger.

290
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,315
That's how eyesight works,
you stupid raccoon.

291
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,799
Don't call me a raccoon!

292
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,634
I'm sorry. I took it too far.

293
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,754
I meant trash panda.

294
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,314
Is that better?

295
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,552
I don't know.

296
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,950
It's worse. It's so much worse.

297
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,348
You son of a...

298
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,236
Hey!

299
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,896
- I've had it with you!
- No! Back up!

300
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,960
Someone followed you
through the jump point.

301
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,875
Set me free, you'll need my help.

302
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,155
I'm not a fool, Nebula.

303
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:33,336
You are a fool if you deprive yourself
a hand in combat.

304
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,696
You'll attack me the moment I let you go.

305
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,720
No, I won't.

306
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:39,156
You'd think an evil supervillain
would learn how to properly lie.

307
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,276
I bet it's the one-inch man.

308
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,875
After all these years, I've found you.

309
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,358
And who the hell are you?

310
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:23,371
I figured my rugged good looks
would make that obvious.

311
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,870
My name is Ego...

312
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,639
and I'm your dad, Peter.

313
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,680
You know what they say...

314
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,718
"You're out of luck
until you've gone duck."

315
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:18,819
Yondu!

316
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,596
Come on down!

317
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,396
After going around
years in circles...

318
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,437
with this woman I end up marrying.

319
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:40,279
I said, "Aleta, I love you, girl...

320
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,873
"but you're losing your mind!"

321
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,996
Then again, she's always been that way.

322
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,957
I could never trust her. You know?

323
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,120
Stakar.

324
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,078
It's been some time.

325
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:01,193
It seems like this establishment
is the wrong kind of disreputable.

326
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,240
- Sir!
- Stakar!

327
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,789
There's a hundred
Ravager factions.

328
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,958
You lost the business of 99 of them
by serving one.

329
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,633
Please, sir. Please!

330
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,068
Get away from me.

331
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:25,313
You can go to hell then!

332
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,636
I don't give a damn what you think of me!

333
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,837
So what are you following us for?

334
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,496
Because you're gonna listen to
what I gotta say!

335
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,953
I don't gotta listen to nothing!

336
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,359
You betrayed the code!

337
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,351
Ravagers don't deal in kids.

338
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:39,353
I told you before!
I didn't know what was going on!

339
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,520
You didn't know because

340
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,216
you didn't want to know
because it made you rich.

341
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,390
I demand a seat at the table!

342
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,550
I wear these flames, same as you.

343
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,490
You may dress like us...

344
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:51,080
But you'll never hear the Horns
of Freedom when you die, Yondu.

345
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,637
And the Colors of Ogord...

346
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:57,290
Will never flash over your grave.

347
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,679
If you think...

348
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:04,031
I take pleasure in exiling you...

349
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,398
You're wrong.

350
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:11,558
You broke all our hearts.

351
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,549
Ah, pathetic.

352
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,671
First, Quill betrays us...

353
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:35,116
and Yondu just lets him go scot-free.

354
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:38,429
We followed him
because he was the one...

355
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:41,034
who wasn't afraid
to do what needed to be done.

356
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:43,470
Seems he's goin' soft.

357
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,469
If he's so soft, why are you whispering?

358
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,917
You know I'm right, Kraglin.

359
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:53,471
You best be very careful
what you say about our captain.

360
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,238
Who the hell is that?

361
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,152
Yondu Udonta...

362
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,790
I have a proposition for you.

363
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:42,396
<i>I hired Yondu to pick you up...</i>

364
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,676
when your mother passed away.

365
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:46,637
But instead of returning you...

366
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,637
Yondu kept you.

367
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:51,394
I have no clue as to why.

368
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,093
Well, I'll tell you why.

369
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,559
Because I was a skinny little kid

370
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,296
who could squeeze into places
adults couldn't.

371
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:58,833
It made it easier for thievin'.

372
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,276
Well, I've been trying to
track you down ever since.

373
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,536
I thought Yondu was your father.

374
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,630
What? We've been together
this whole time...

375
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:09,598
and you thought Yondu
was my actual blood relative?

376
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,988
You look exactly alike.

377
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:12,898
One's blue!

378
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:16,078
No, he's not my father!

379
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,408
Yondu was the guy who abducted me...

380
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,616
Kicked the crap out of me
so I could learn to fight...

381
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,731
and kept me in terror
by threatening to eat me.

382
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:24,453
- Eat you?
- Yeah.

383
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,511
Oh, that son of a bitch.

384
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,033
How'd you locate us now?

385
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:31,832
Well, even where I reside,
out past the edge of what's known...

386
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:34,429
we've heard tell about the man
they call Star-Lord.

387
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,789
What say we head out there right now?

388
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:40,100
Your associates are welcome.
Even that triangle-faced monkey there.

389
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,868
I promise you...

390
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,351
it's unlike any other place
you've ever seen.

391
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,349
And there...

392
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:50,515
I can explain your very special heritage.

393
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,671
Finally get to be...

394
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:56,559
the father I've always wanted to be.

395
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,513
Excuse me.

396
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,399
I've gotta take a whiz.

397
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,278
I'm not buying it.

398
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,192
Let's go take a walk.

399
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,399
I am Mantis.

400
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,559
What are you doing?

401
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,233
Smiling.

402
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:31,514
I hear it is the thing to do
to make people like you.

403
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,750
Not if you do it like that.

404
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,275
Oh...

405
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:38,920
I was raised alone on Ego's planet.

406
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:43,790
I do not understand
the intricacies of social interaction.

407
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:49,835
Can I pet your puppy?
It is adorable.

408
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:53,715
Yes.

409
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:06,635
That is called a practical joke!

410
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,951
I liked it very much!

411
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,792
I just made it up!

412
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,640
Give me a break!

413
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:19,560
After all this time,

414
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,096
you're gonna show up,
and all of a sudden...

415
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,917
- you wanna be my dad?
- I hear you.

416
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,150
And by the way,
this could be a trap.

417
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,878
The Kree purists, the Ravagers...

418
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,712
- they all want us dead.
- I know, but...

419
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:29,835
But what?

420
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:32,309
What was that story you told me
about Zardu Hasselfrau?

421
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,435
Who?

422
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,828
He owned a magic boat?

423
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,154
David Hasselhoff?

424
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:38,950
Right.

425
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:41,090
Not a magic boat. A talking car.

426
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:42,560
Why did he talk again?

427
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:46,235
To help him fight crime,
and to be supportive.

428
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:48,894
As a child, you would carry
his picture in your pocket...

429
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:50,812
and you would tell
all the other children...

430
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,230
that he was your father,
but that he was out of town.

431
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:55,914
Shooting <i>Knight Rider</i>
or touring with his band in Germany.

432
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,496
I told you that when I was drunk.
Why are you bringing that up now?

433
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,589
I love that story.

434
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,716
I hate that story.

435
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,313
It's so sad!

436
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:08,517
As a kid, I used to see all the other kids
off playing catch with their dad.

437
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:11,353
And I wanted that,
more than anything in the world!

438
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,392
That's my point, Peter.

439
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:17,473
What if this man is your Hasselhoff?

440
00:32:20,212 --> 00:32:20,796
Listen...

441
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,653
If he ends up being evil...

442
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,398
We will just kill him.

443
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,160
You're leaving me with that fox?

444
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,315
He's not a fox.

445
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,556
Shoot her if she does
anything suspicious.

446
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,496
- Or if you feel like it.
- Okay.

447
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:42,996
Hey..

448
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:45,550
It'll be just a couple of days.

449
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:48,358
We'll be back before
Rocket's finished fixing the ship.

450
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,631
What if the Sovereign come?

451
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:56,016
There's no way for them
to know we're here. Let's go.

452
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,632
I'm uncertain about parting ways.

453
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,392
God, you're like an old woman.

454
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,232
Because I'm wise?

455
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:04,156
Why do you have
so much luggage?

456
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,470
I don't want Groot
playing with my things.

457
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:12,120
I hope Daddy isn't as big of a dick
as you, orphan boy.

458
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:17,954
What is your goal here?
To get everybody to hate you?

459
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:20,910
Because it's working.

472
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,356
Hey, can I ask you
a personal question?

473
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,560
Oh...

474
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:14,475
No one has ever asked me
a personal question.

475
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,399
Your antenna, what are they for?

476
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,249
Their purpose?

477
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,151
Yes. Quill and I have a bet.

478
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,390
Dude. You're not supposed to say that!

479
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,475
I say...

480
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:27,029
if you are about to go through
a doorway that is too low...

481
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,998
your antenna will feel this,
and keep you from being decapitated.

482
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:32,310
Right.
And if it's anything other than...

483
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:35,870
you specifically not being decapitated
by a doorway, I win.

484
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:38,508
They are not for feeling doorways.

485
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,400
I think...

486
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:44,319
they have something to do
with my empathic abilities.

487
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:45,880
What are those?

488
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:49,550
If I touch someone,
I can feel their feelings.

489
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:52,472
- You read minds?
- No.

490
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:54,915
Telepaths know thoughts.

491
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,514
Empaths feel feelings.

492
00:34:58,680 --> 00:34:59,680
Emotions.

493
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,475
May I?

494
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,033
All right.

495
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,749
You feel love.

496
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,392
Yeah. I guess I feel a general,
unselfish love for just about everybody.

497
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:22,709
No!

498
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,711
Romantic, sexual love.

499
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,319
No, I don't.

500
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:27,978
- For her!
- No!

501
00:35:28,199 --> 00:35:29,399
That is not...

502
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:32,375
Okay.

503
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:37,970
She just told everyone
your deepest, darkest secret!

504
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,249
Dude, come on!
I think you're overreacting a little bit!

505
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,839
You must be so embarrassed!

506
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:46,957
Do me! Do me!

507
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:55,878
I have never felt such humor!

508
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,391
So unbelievably uncool.

509
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,193
Oh, Quill.

510
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:10,519
Touch me, and the only thing
you're gonna feel is a broken jaw.

511
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:19,509
I can also alter emotions to some extent.

512
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:20,680
Yeah, like what?

513
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:24,677
If I touch someone who is sad...

514
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:27,513
I can ease them into contentment
for a short while.

515
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:31,548
I can make a stubborn person compliant.

516
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:34,757
But I mostly use it
to help my master sleep.

517
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:38,794
He lies awake at night
thinking about his progeny.

518
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:42,209
Do one of those on me.

519
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:48,272
Sleep.

520
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:42,680
<i>I love this song.</i>

521
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:13,680
Huh?

522
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:15,954
There!

523
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:28,800
Ah...

524
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:38,614
Ain't so tough now without
all your toys...

525
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,896
are you?

526
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:43,935
Move!

527
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:01,955
Crap.

528
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:08,993
Hey there, rat!

529
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:11,469
How's it going, you blue idiot?

530
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,036
Not so bad.

531
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:16,689
We got ourselves a pretty good
little gig here.

532
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:19,593
This golden gal with
quite a high opinion of herself...

533
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:23,873
has offered us a large sum to deliver you
and your pals over to her...

534
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:25,340
because she wants to kill y'all.

535
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:27,828
Your friend...

536
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,672
There's too many of them.

537
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:33,037
He needs my help.
If you care about him...

538
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:35,834
you need to get me out of these bonds.

539
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:38,351
They are going to kill him!

540
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:40,670
I tell you,
it was pretty easy to find you.

541
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,756
I put a tracer on your ship back there...

542
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:44,179
during the war over Xandar.

543
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,389
Give me your word
you won't hurt Groot, and...

544
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:49,337
I'll tell you where the batteries are.

545
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:52,469
Lucky for you,
my word don't mean squat.

546
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,190
Otherwise, I'd actually hand you over.

547
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,713
Otherwise, you'd what?

548
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,399
We'll take them batteries.

549
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:03,036
They're worth what?
A quarter mill on the open market?

550
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,509
That Priestess offered us a million.

551
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:08,539
A quarter is only one third of that!

552
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:09,715
A quarter ain't a third.

553
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:11,577
A quarter is 25.

554
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:12,740
No.

555
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,409
We can't even buy
a pair of boots with 25 units.

556
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,475
Enough!

557
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:21,375
The point is, we ain't stupid enough
to help kill the Guardians of the Galaxy!

558
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:24,448
The whole dang Nova Corps
would be on us.

559
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:26,671
That ain't right!

560
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:30,277
I just gotta say it
this one time, Captain.

561
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:32,749
No matter how many times
Quill betrays you...

562
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:35,798
you protect him like
none of the rest of us much matter!

563
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:36,860
Yeah!

564
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,633
I'm the one what sticks up for you!

565
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:39,800
Take it easy, Kraglin.

566
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:42,388
Damn straight, lad. He's gone soft.

567
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:45,637
Suppose it's time for a change
in leadership.

568
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:53,090
Put your damn guns down!

569
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:54,434
Whoa! Whoa!

570
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:58,036
There must be some kind of
peaceful resolution to this, fellas.

571
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:00,913
Or even a violent one
where I'm standing over there.

572
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:21,752
Well, hello, boys.

573
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:28,998
It's not ripe.

574
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:17,270
Welcome, everyone, to my world.

575
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:19,828
Wow.
You have your own planet?

576
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:23,708
Come on.
No larger than your Earth's Moon.

577
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:25,433
Humility.

578
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:26,999
I like it.

579
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:29,715
I, too, am extraordinarily humble.

580
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:16,358
You own a planet and can destroy
two dozen spaceships without a suit.

581
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:18,757
What are you exactly?

582
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:23,151
I'm what's called a Celestial, sweetheart.

583
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:26,994
A Celestial, like a god?

584
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:30,754
Mmm, small "g," son.

585
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:33,713
At least on the days
I'm feeling humble as Drax.

586
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:51,470
I don't know where I came from exactly.

587
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:53,596
First thing I remember is flickering...

588
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:56,071
adrift in the cosmos utterly...

589
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:59,514
and entirely alone.

590
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:02,511
Over millions of years...

591
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:06,275
I learned to control
the molecules around me.

592
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:09,712
I grew smarter and stronger.

593
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:14,718
And I continued building from there...

594
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,996
layer by layer...

595
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:19,754
the very planet you walk on now.

596
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:21,194
Whoa.

597
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:22,949
But I wanted more.

598
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:25,838
I desired...

599
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:27,469
meaning.

600
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:32,639
"There must be some life
out there in the universe...

601
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:35,553
"besides just me," I thought.

602
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:39,753
And so, I set myself the task
of finding it.

603
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:41,553
I created...

604
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:45,349
what I imagined biological life
to be like...

605
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:49,274
down to the most minute detail.

606
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:51,753
Did you make a penis?

607
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:53,114
Dude!

608
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:54,508
What is wrong with you?

609
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:57,672
If he is a planet, how could he
make a baby with your mother?

610
00:45:57,840 --> 00:45:59,240
He would smush her!

611
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:03,275
I don't need to hear how my parents...

612
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:05,520
Why?

613
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:07,872
My father would tell the story

614
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:09,871
of impregnating my mother
every winter solstice.

615
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:11,473
That's disgusting.

616
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:13,073
It was beautiful.

617
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:15,839
You Earthers have hang-ups.

618
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:18,470
Yes, Drax, I got a penis.

619
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:20,358
Ha! Thank you!

620
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:21,635
It's not half bad.

621
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:23,233
- Oh.
- Ugh.

622
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:27,035
I've also got pain receptors,
and a digestive system...

623
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:28,952
and all the accompanying junk.

624
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:34,070
I wanted to experience
what it truly meant to be human...

625
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:37,232
as I set out amongst the stars...

626
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:40,115
until I found...

627
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:41,952
what I sought.

628
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:44,709
Life.

629
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:48,749
I was not alone in the universe after all.

630
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:57,391
When did you meet my mother?

631
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:03,232
Not long after.

632
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:13,676
It was with Meredith
that I first experienced love.

633
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:20,751
I called her my river lily.

634
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,514
And from that love, Peter...

635
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:32,354
you.

636
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:43,155
I have searched for you for so long.

637
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:46,432
And when I heard of a man from Earth...

638
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:50,354
who held an Infinity Stone
in his hand without dying...

639
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:55,078
I knew you must be the son
of the woman I loved.

640
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:59,069
If you loved her, why did you leave her?

641
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:22,037
This is mutiny!

642
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:27,828
This is mutiny!

643
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:41,033
<i>You're scum!</i>

644
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:17,729
Captain!

645
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:20,360
Help me! Please!

646
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:22,073
Captain!

647
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:27,032
You're the one what killed those men...

648
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:29,437
by leading them down the wrong path.

649
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:31,958
Because you're weak.

650
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:35,953
And stupid!

651
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:40,176
It's time for the Ravagers...

652
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:44,115
to rise once again to glory
with a new captain...

653
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:46,438
Taserface!

654
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:57,789
I'm sorry. Your name is...

655
00:49:57,960 --> 00:49:59,598
It's Taserface?

656
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:01,399
That's right.

657
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:04,075
Do you shoot tasers out of your face?

658
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:06,557
It's metaphorical!

659
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:07,720
Yeah!

660
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:12,320
For what?

661
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:17,194
For it is a name what strikes fear...

662
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:20,113
into the hearts of anyone what hears it.

663
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:24,028
Okay.

664
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:25,868
Okay...

665
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:27,229
whatever you say.

666
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:29,079
You shut up.

667
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:30,434
You're next.

668
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:34,673
Udonta, I have waited a long time to do...

669
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:35,920
What?

670
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:40,072
I'm sorry. I am so sorry!

671
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:43,277
I just keep imagining you
waking up in the morning, sir...

672
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:46,512
looking in the mirror and then
in all seriousness saying to yourself...

673
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:49,114
"You know what would be
a really kick-ass name?

674
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:51,549
"Taserface!"

675
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:55,200
That's how I hear you in my head!

676
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:58,270
What was your second choice?

677
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:00,271
Scrotum Hat?

678
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:05,200
New plan!
We're killing you first.

679
00:51:05,562 --> 00:51:06,562
Well...

680
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:09,677
Dying is certainly better
than having to live an entire life...

681
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:13,833
as a moronic shitbag who thinks
Taserface is a cool name.

682
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,833
That's enough killing for today.

683
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:22,478
She's the daughter of Thanos.

684
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:27,016
I thought you were
the biggest sadist in the galaxy.

685
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:29,873
That was when Daddy
was paying my bills.

686
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:33,669
The Priestess wants to
kill the fox herself.

687
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:36,673
And he has bounties on his head
in at least 12 Kree provinces.

688
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:39,833
I assure you...

689
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,833
I am not as easy a mark as an old man
without his magic stick...

690
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,831
or a talking woodland beast.

691
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:48,071
I want 10% of the take...

692
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:51,518
and a couple more things.

693
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:54,998
We got
a whole box of hands...

694
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:56,991
- if that one don't work out.
- It is fine.

695
00:51:57,160 --> 00:52:00,357
You think them Kree
is gonna execute the captain?

696
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:04,752
The Kree consider themselves merciful.
It will be painless.

697
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:08,356
Well, here it is.
It's the best ship we got.

698
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:10,198
Location of Ego's planet in the nav.

699
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:12,669
We'll wire you the 10% once we's paid.

700
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:14,956
What are you gonna do with your share?

701
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:18,155
As a child, my father
would have Gamora and me

702
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:20,077
battle one another in training.

703
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:23,189
Every time my sister prevailed...

704
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:26,670
my father would replace a piece of me
with machinery...

705
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:29,513
claiming he wanted me to be her equal.

706
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:32,431
But she won...

707
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:37,435
again and again, and again,
never once refraining.

708
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:41,389
So after I murder my sister...

709
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:42,709
I will buy a warship

710
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:44,791
with every conceivable
instrument of death.

711
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:48,589
I will hunt my father like a dog,
and I will tear him apart slowly...

712
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:50,193
piece by piece...

713
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:53,750
until he knows some semblance
of the profound and unceasing pain...

714
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:57,037
I know every single day.

715
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:00,273
Yeah.

716
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:02,520
I was talking about,
like, a pretty necklace.

717
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:05,231
Or a nice hat.

718
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:08,119
Something to make the other girls go,
"Ooh, that's nice!"

719
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:15,277
Anyways, happy trails.

720
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:26,516
My mother told everyone
my father was from the stars.

721
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:30,794
She had brain cancer,
so everyone thought she was delusional.

722
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:31,995
Peter...

723
00:53:32,060 --> 00:53:33,956
Listen, I'd love to believe all of this,
I really would.

724
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:35,479
But you left...

725
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:38,438
the most wonderful woman ever...

726
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:40,119
to die alone.

727
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:43,710
I didn't want to leave your mother, Peter.

728
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:46,030
If I don't return regularly
to my planet...

729
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:47,593
and the light within it...

730
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:49,318
this form will wither and perish.

731
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:51,520
So why didn't you come back?
Why did you send Yondu?

732
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:53,551
A criminal, of all people,
to come and fetch me?

733
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,956
I loved your mother, Peter!

734
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:58,475
I couldn't stand to set foot
on an Earth...

735
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:01,473
where she wasn't living!
You can't imagine what that's like!

736
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:04,029
I know exactly what that feels like!

737
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:05,952
I had to watch her die!

738
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:14,472
Over the millions and millions
of years of my existence...

739
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:17,108
I've made many mistakes, Peter.

740
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:20,155
But you're not one of them.

741
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:25,709
Please give me the chance to be
the father she would want me to be.

742
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:35,710
There's so much that I need to
teach you about this planet...

743
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:37,552
and the light within.

744
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:41,117
They are a part of you, Peter.

745
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:43,632
What do you mean?

746
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:46,351
Give me your hands, son.

747
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:48,475
Here.

748
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:51,237
Hold them like that.

749
00:54:57,160 --> 00:55:00,038
Now, close your eyes and concentrate.

750
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:04,158
Take your brain
to the center of this planet.

751
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:10,911
Yes!

752
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:13,078
Whoa!

753
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:14,593
Yes! It's okay.

754
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:15,829
Just relax. Concentrate.

755
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:18,110
You can do it. Bring it back.

756
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:19,749
Yes!

757
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:24,198
Yes, now shape it.

758
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:26,232
Feel that energy.

759
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:31,400
Yes.

760
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:37,039
You're home.

761
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:40,749
Peter...

762
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:18,158
How did you get to
this weird, dumb planet?

763
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:21,678
Ego found me
in my larva state.

764
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:23,273
Orphaned on my homeworld.

765
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:26,900
He raised me by hand,
and kept me as his own.

766
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:29,679
So you're a pet?

767
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:32,279
I suppose.

768
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:36,155
People usually want cute pets.

769
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:38,595
Why would Ego want
such a hideous one?

770
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:40,079
I am hideous?

771
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:42,390
You are horrifying to look at. Yes.

772
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:46,635
But that's a good thing.

773
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:47,840
Oh?

774
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:49,872
When you're ugly,
and someone loves you...

775
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:52,474
you know they love you for who you are.

776
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:56,195
Beautiful people never know
who to trust.

777
00:56:57,160 --> 00:56:59,993
Well, then I'm certainly grateful
to be ugly.

778
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:04,671
Those pools,
they remind me of a time...

779
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:08,355
when I took my daughter
to the forgotten lakes of my homeworld.

780
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:10,834
She was like you.

781
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:12,753
Disgusting?

782
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:14,989
Innocent.

783
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:49,200
Drax?

784
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:52,512
There's something I must tell you.

785
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:02,069
What's going on?

786
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:04,117
This gross bug lady is my new friend.

787
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:07,670
I'm learning many things,
like I'm a pet and ugly.

788
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:09,593
You're not ugly. Drax!

789
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:11,079
What are you talking about?

790
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:12,389
Mantis...

791
00:58:12,620 --> 00:58:14,611
can you show us where we'll be staying?

792
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:17,280
Why are there no other beings
on this planet?

793
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:19,510
The planet is Ego.

794
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:21,915
A dog would not invite a flea
to live on his back.

795
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:23,914
And you're not a flea?

796
00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:26,429
I'm a flea with a purpose.

797
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:28,638
I help him sleep.

798
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:32,952
What were you about to say to Drax
before I walked out?

799
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:39,075
Nothing.

800
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:41,917
Your quarters are this way.

801
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:52,990
We deliver you to the Kree
in the morning.

802
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:58,437
Neither one of you will last
much longer after that.

803
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:01,156
Okay, Taserface.

804
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:03,990
Hey, tell the other guys we said...

805
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:05,559
"Hi," Taserface!

806
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:13,234
What about this little plant?
Can I smash it with a rock?

807
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:14,953
No, Gef.

808
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:16,792
It's too adorable to kill.

809
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:18,791
Take it to the tailor.

810
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:23,631
No offense, but your employees
are a bunch of jerks.

811
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:30,830
I was a Kree battle slave for 20 years
when Stakar freed me.

812
00:59:33,120 --> 00:59:35,759
He offered me a place
with the Ravagers.

813
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:40,717
He said all I needed to do
was adhere to the code.

814
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:42,677
But I was young...

815
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:47,076
and greedy, and stupid.

816
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:50,156
Like you stealing those batteries.

817
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:51,833
That was mostly Drax.

818
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:56,829
Me and Stakar and the other captains...

819
00:59:57,800 --> 01:00:00,109
we weren't so different from
you and your friends.

820
01:00:01,080 --> 01:00:02,991
The only family I ever had.

821
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:06,112
When I broke the code...

822
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:10,032
they exiled me.

823
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:12,793
This is what I deserve.

824
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,672
Slow down, drama queen.

825
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:16,518
You might deserve this, but I don't.

826
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:18,432
We gotta get outta here.

827
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:21,035
Where's Quill?

828
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:23,358
He went off with his old man.

829
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:26,198
- Ego?
- Yeah.

830
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:28,316
It's a day for dumbass names.

831
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:33,829
You're smiling.
And for a second, I got a warm feeling.

832
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,753
But then it was ruined
by those disgusting-ass teeth.

833
01:00:36,840 --> 01:00:39,308
You like a professional asshole or what?

834
01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:40,480
Pretty much a pro.

835
01:00:40,560 --> 01:00:43,233
Why didn't you deliver Quill to Ego
like you promised?

836
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:45,598
He was skinny.

837
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:50,112
Could fit into places we couldn't.
Good for thievin'.

838
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:51,600
Uh-huh.

839
01:00:55,320 --> 01:00:58,437
I got an idea on how to get outta here.

840
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:01,714
But we're gonna need your little friend.

841
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:05,235
Mascot, mascot, mascot...

842
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:18,675
Little fellow's all worked up!
He needs a drink!

843
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:27,479
Look how cute it is
when it's all riled up.

844
01:01:27,640 --> 01:01:29,517
He's goddang precious!

845
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:43,480
Psst!

846
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:45,278
Hey, twig!

847
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:46,999
Come here.

848
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:48,708
Come on.

849
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:56,280
Aw, man...

850
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:57,913
what did they do to you?

851
01:02:01,040 --> 01:02:03,474
Hey, you wanna help us get outta here?

852
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:07,517
There's something I need you to get,
and bring back to me.

853
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:11,719
In the captain's quarters,
there's a prototype fin...

854
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:13,512
the thing I wore on my head.

855
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:18,279
There's a drawer next to the bunk.
It's in that. It's red.

856
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:19,754
You got it?

857
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:54,999
That's my underwears.

858
01:02:55,160 --> 01:02:57,376
Yeah, I was pretty sure he didn't know
what you were talkin' about.

859
01:02:57,400 --> 01:02:59,391
You have to explain it more careful.

860
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:04,350
It's a prototype fin.

861
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:12,593
That's an orloni.
It's a fin, Groot.

862
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:14,352
You explain it this time.

863
01:03:15,640 --> 01:03:17,039
All right.

864
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:19,757
That's Vorker's eye.

865
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:21,911
He takes it out when he sleeps.

866
01:03:22,080 --> 01:03:23,433
Go. Look again.

867
01:03:23,500 --> 01:03:24,899
But leave the eye here.

868
01:03:25,460 --> 01:03:26,575
Why?

869
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:27,993
He's gonna wake up tomorrow...

870
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:30,555
and he's not gonna know...

871
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:32,950
where his eye is!

872
01:03:39,160 --> 01:03:40,718
That's a desk.

873
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:43,593
We told you it was this big.

874
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:51,755
Tell me you guys have
a refrigerator somewhere...

875
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:54,639
with a bunch of severed human toes.

876
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:58,395
Okay. Then let's just agree
to never discuss this.

877
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:05,355
The drawer you wanna open
has this symbol on it.

878
01:04:05,720 --> 01:04:07,073
Okay?

879
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:16,977
What? No!

880
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:18,596
He thinks you want him
to wear it as a hat.

881
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:20,039
That's not what I said!

882
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:21,200
I am Groot.

883
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:22,456
He's relieved you don't want him to.

884
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:23,959
- I am Groot.
- He hates hats.

885
01:04:24,120 --> 01:04:24,791
I am Groot.

886
01:04:24,900 --> 01:04:26,049
On anyone, not just himself.

887
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:27,150
I am Groot.

888
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:29,296
One minute you think someone
has a weird-shaped head...

889
01:04:29,320 --> 01:04:32,176
the next minute it's just because
you realize part of that head is the hat.

890
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:33,474
That's why you don't like hats?

891
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:36,755
This is an important conversation
right now?

892
01:05:14,080 --> 01:05:14,880
That ain't it.

893
01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:25,933
I didn't mean to do a mutiny.

894
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:30,911
They killed all my friends.

895
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:37,474
Get the third quadrant ready for release.

896
01:05:44,500 --> 01:05:45,500
One more thing.

897
01:05:46,940 --> 01:05:49,249
You got any clones of Quill's old music 
on the ship?

898
01:06:40,320 --> 01:06:41,251
He's got it!

899
01:06:41,320 --> 01:06:42,833
<i>Yondu's got the fin!</i>

900
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:44,000
Go!

901
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:26,440
Down there!

902
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:51,991
Oh!

903
01:09:25,280 --> 01:09:26,614
You maniac.

904
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:30,755
The whole ship's gonna blow.

905
01:09:40,680 --> 01:09:42,272
Not the whole ship.

906
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:00,375
<i>Who is this?</i>

907
01:10:00,440 --> 01:10:04,718
I am sending you
the coordinates for Yondu's ship.

908
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:07,077
- Release the quadrant!
- Aye, Captain!

909
01:10:07,240 --> 01:10:09,754
I only ask one thing.

910
01:10:10,240 --> 01:10:11,878
That your High Priestess...

911
01:10:12,040 --> 01:10:15,510
tell him the name of the man
what sealed his fate.

912
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:19,717
Taserface!

913
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:43,308
Where to, Captain?

914
01:10:43,480 --> 01:10:44,480
Ego.

915
01:10:46,120 --> 01:10:47,155
No, boy!

916
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:59,591
It ain't healthy for a mammalian body
to hop more than 50 jumps at a time.

917
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:00,760
I know that.

918
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:03,235
We are about to do 700!

919
01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:19,236
So I guess this could
all be mine someday.

920
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:23,114
Rocket? Rocket, are you there?

921
01:11:30,360 --> 01:11:32,078
What are you doing, Peter?

922
01:11:34,360 --> 01:11:35,679
Dance with me.

923
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:37,353
I'm not going to dance with you.

924
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:39,278
This is Sam Cooke...

925
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:42,991
one of the greatest
Earth singers of all time.

926
01:12:12,160 --> 01:12:14,151
Drax thinks you're not a dancer.

927
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:17,840
If you ever tell anyone about this...

928
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,399
I will kill you.

929
01:12:20,160 --> 01:12:24,039
When are we gonna do something
about this unspoken thing between us?

930
01:12:24,680 --> 01:12:26,079
What unspoken thing?

931
01:12:27,560 --> 01:12:29,232
This...

932
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:32,198
<i>Cheers,</i> Sam and Diane...

933
01:12:32,360 --> 01:12:34,920
a guy and a girl on a TV show
who dig each other...

934
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:36,536
but never say it because if they do,

935
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:37,680
the ratings would go down...

936
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:38,869
sort of thing.

937
01:12:39,040 --> 01:12:40,473
There's no unspoken thing.

938
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:44,436
Well, it's a catch-22,
because if you said it,

939
01:12:44,520 --> 01:12:45,669
then it would be spoken...

940
01:12:45,880 --> 01:12:48,599
and you would be a liar.
So, by not saying it...

941
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:52,918
you are telling the truth,
and admitting that there is.

942
01:12:53,080 --> 01:12:54,991
No, that's not what I...

943
01:12:57,320 --> 01:13:01,359
What we should be discussing right now
is something about this place.

944
01:13:01,560 --> 01:13:03,232
It doesn't feel right.

945
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:05,950
What are you talking about?

946
01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:07,536
You're the one who wanted me
to come here!

947
01:13:07,560 --> 01:13:08,788
That girl Mantis...

948
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:10,029
she's afraid of something.

949
01:13:10,480 --> 01:13:12,516
Why are you trying to take this
away from me?

950
01:13:12,760 --> 01:13:13,875
I'm not trying...

951
01:13:14,040 --> 01:13:15,951
He's my father. He's blood.

952
01:13:16,160 --> 01:13:17,936
You have blood on Earth
and you never wanted to return there.

953
01:13:17,960 --> 01:13:20,076
Again, you made me come here!

954
01:13:20,240 --> 01:13:22,296
And Earth is the place
where my mother died in front of me.

955
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:24,959
No, it's because that place is real,
and this is a fantasy.

956
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:27,873
This is real!
I'm only half human, remember?

957
01:13:28,040 --> 01:13:29,400
That's the half I'm worried about.

958
01:13:29,452 --> 01:13:30,016
Oh..

959
01:13:30,040 --> 01:13:31,678
I get it. You're jealous...

960
01:13:31,680 --> 01:13:34,389
because I'm part-god,
and you like when I'm the weak one.

961
01:13:34,460 --> 01:13:36,974
You were insufferable to begin with.

962
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:38,336
I haven't been able to reach Rocket.

963
01:13:38,360 --> 01:13:39,856
I'm gonna go outside,
and I'm gonna try and get a signal.

964
01:13:39,880 --> 01:13:42,838
You know what?
This is not <i>Cheers</i> after all!

965
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,833
This is whatever the show is
where one person is willing...

966
01:13:45,900 --> 01:13:47,618
to open themselves up
to new possibility,

967
01:13:47,700 --> 01:13:49,472
and the other person is a jerk...

968
01:13:49,540 --> 01:13:51,337
who doesn't trust anybody!

969
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:53,272
It's a show that doesn't exist.

970
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:54,920
That's why it would get zero ratings!

971
01:13:55,360 --> 01:13:57,476
I don't know what <i>Cheers</i> is!

972
01:13:57,680 --> 01:14:00,638
I finally found my family.
Don't you understand that?

973
01:14:01,880 --> 01:14:03,518
I thought you already had.

974
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:34,268
Damn it.

975
01:15:07,660 --> 01:15:08,629
Psychopath!

976
01:17:19,080 --> 01:17:20,552
Are you kidding me?

977
01:17:47,400 --> 01:17:48,400
I win.

978
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:50,795
I win. I bested you in combat.

979
01:17:50,860 --> 01:17:52,771
No. I saved your life.

980
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:54,871
Well, you were stupid enough
to let me live.

981
01:17:55,040 --> 01:17:56,040
You let me live!

982
01:17:56,080 --> 01:17:57,957
I don't need you always
trying to beat me!

983
01:17:58,020 --> 01:17:59,436
I'm not the one that just
flew across the universe

984
01:17:59,560 --> 01:18:00,754
just because I wanted to win.

985
01:18:00,920 --> 01:18:02,558
Do not tell me what I want.

986
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:04,200
I don't need to tell you what you want!

987
01:18:04,240 --> 01:18:05,240
It's obvious!

988
01:18:05,300 --> 01:18:08,258
You were the one who wanted to win.
And I just wanted a sister!

989
01:18:16,240 --> 01:18:17,753
You were all I had.

990
01:18:19,220 --> 01:18:21,893
But you were the one
who needed to win.

991
01:18:23,120 --> 01:18:25,315
Thanos pulled my eye from my head...

992
01:18:26,120 --> 01:18:28,111
and my brain from my skull...

993
01:18:29,280 --> 01:18:31,157
and my arm from my body...

994
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:34,916
because of you.

995
01:18:55,840 --> 01:18:56,955
You all right, son?

996
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:02,959
I saw your girl stomp off
a little earlier in quite a huff.

997
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:04,953
Yeah.

998
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:06,838
It's fortuitous...

999
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:08,228
you listening to this song.

1000
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:09,958
- You know...
<i>- Brandy?</i>

1001
01:19:10,440 --> 01:19:11,475
By Looking Glass?

1002
01:19:13,360 --> 01:19:14,800
A favorite of your mom's.

1003
01:19:15,640 --> 01:19:17,153
Yeah, it was.

1004
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:19,360
One of Earth's greatest
musical compositions.

1005
01:19:19,440 --> 01:19:21,510
Perhaps its very greatest.

1006
01:19:21,680 --> 01:19:22,680
Yes!

1007
01:19:22,840 --> 01:19:25,957
Peter, you and I,
we're the sailor in that song.

1008
01:19:28,240 --> 01:19:29,992
<i>He came on a summer's day</i>

1009
01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:32,948
<i>Bringing gifts from far away</i>

1010
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:37,508
Like the child I put in your mother...

1011
01:19:37,580 --> 01:19:39,491
or the freedom you brought Gamora.

1012
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:44,797
<i>Brandy, you're a fine girl</i>

1013
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:47,599
<i>What a good wife you would be</i>

1014
01:19:48,720 --> 01:19:51,359
<i>My life, my love</i>

1015
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:54,796
<i>My lady is the sea</i>

1016
01:19:54,960 --> 01:19:56,791
The sea calls the sailor back.

1017
01:19:56,960 --> 01:19:59,474
He loves the girl,
but that's not his place.

1018
01:20:00,280 --> 01:20:04,193
The sea calls upon him
as history calls upon great men.

1019
01:20:05,480 --> 01:20:08,916
And sometimes we are deprived
the pleasures of mortals.

1020
01:20:09,560 --> 01:20:11,676
Well, you may not be mortal, but me...

1021
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:12,955
No, Peter...

1022
01:20:13,160 --> 01:20:15,071
death will remain a stranger
to both of us...

1023
01:20:15,560 --> 01:20:17,630
as long as the light
burns within the planet.

1024
01:20:18,680 --> 01:20:19,715
I'm immortal?

1025
01:20:20,240 --> 01:20:21,240
Mmm-hmm.

1026
01:20:22,040 --> 01:20:23,075
Really?

1027
01:20:23,240 --> 01:20:26,073
Yes! As long as the light exists.

1028
01:20:26,980 --> 01:20:30,211
And I can use the light
to build cool things...

1029
01:20:30,480 --> 01:20:32,789
like how you made this whole planet?

1030
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:35,315
It might take you
a few million years of practice...

1031
01:20:35,480 --> 01:20:37,755
before you get really good at it.
But, yes!

1032
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:38,920
What!

1033
01:20:39,400 --> 01:20:42,970
Get ready for an 800-foot statue
of Pac-Man with Skeletor...

1034
01:20:43,040 --> 01:20:43,975
and Heather Locklear.

1035
01:20:44,040 --> 01:20:45,200
You can do anything you want.

1036
01:20:45,400 --> 01:20:46,674
I'm gonna make some weird shit.

1037
01:20:46,840 --> 01:20:49,991
But you know, Peter,
it is a tremendous responsibility.

1038
01:20:50,160 --> 01:20:52,674
Only we can remake the universe.

1039
01:20:52,840 --> 01:20:55,308
Only we can take the bridle
of the cosmos...

1040
01:20:55,480 --> 01:20:58,313
and lead it to where it needs to go.

1041
01:20:59,480 --> 01:21:00,515
How?

1042
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:12,353
Come with me.

1043
01:21:22,360 --> 01:21:23,952
Drax, Drax. Drax!

1044
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:25,958
Drax! We need to talk.

1045
01:21:28,220 --> 01:21:29,951
I'm sorry.

1046
01:21:30,120 --> 01:21:32,315
But I like a woman
with some meat on her bones.

1047
01:21:32,480 --> 01:21:33,549
What?

1048
01:21:33,720 --> 01:21:36,951
I tried to let you down easily
by telling you I found you disgusting.

1049
01:21:37,160 --> 01:21:38,513
No, that's not what I...

1050
01:21:42,120 --> 01:21:43,519
What are you doing?

1051
01:21:44,160 --> 01:21:46,469
I'm imagining being with you physically.

1052
01:21:46,640 --> 01:21:47,959
Drax...

1053
01:21:48,480 --> 01:21:49,629
I don't like you like that.

1054
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:52,149
I don't even like
the type of thing you are.

1055
01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:54,754
Hey! 
There's no need to get personal.

1056
01:21:54,920 --> 01:21:57,480
Listen! 
Ego's gotten exactly what he wanted.

1057
01:21:57,680 --> 01:21:59,398
I should have told you earlier.

1058
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:02,592
I'm stupid. You are in danger.

1059
01:22:08,360 --> 01:22:09,360
What is that?

1060
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:16,396
Now, you need to readjust
the way you process life.

1061
01:22:16,640 --> 01:22:19,712
Everything around us,
including the girl...

1062
01:22:19,880 --> 01:22:23,350
Everything is temporary.

1063
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:26,318
We are forever.

1064
01:22:26,600 --> 01:22:27,953
Doesn't eternity get boring?

1065
01:22:28,120 --> 01:22:30,509
Not if you have a purpose, Peter...

1066
01:22:30,680 --> 01:22:32,636
which is why you're here.

1067
01:22:32,840 --> 01:22:34,956
I told you how all those years ago...

1068
01:22:35,120 --> 01:22:39,238
I had an unceasing impulse to find life.

1069
01:22:39,400 --> 01:22:43,439
But what I did not tell you was how,
when I finally did find it...

1070
01:22:44,120 --> 01:22:45,394
it was all so...

1071
01:22:47,880 --> 01:22:49,711
disappointing.

1072
01:22:50,040 --> 01:22:53,555
<i>And that is when I came...</i>

1073
01:22:53,720 --> 01:22:57,395
to a profound realization.

1074
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:02,873
My innate desire to seek out other life...

1075
01:23:03,480 --> 01:23:07,632
was not so that I could
walk among that life.

1076
01:23:09,880 --> 01:23:11,029
Peter...

1077
01:23:12,080 --> 01:23:15,277
I have found meaning.

1078
01:23:35,160 --> 01:23:36,513
I see it.

1079
01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:40,712
Eternity!

1080
01:23:41,160 --> 01:23:42,639
Oh, my God.

1081
01:23:53,280 --> 01:23:55,157
We need to get off this planet.

1082
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:10,274
Oh, man.

1083
01:24:10,480 --> 01:24:12,789
Anyway, before I was
so rudely interrupted...

1084
01:24:12,960 --> 01:24:15,838
At that time,
I was a Federal Express man.

1085
01:24:26,840 --> 01:24:28,990
What the hell you doing, boy?

1086
01:24:29,080 --> 01:24:31,150
I could tell
by how you talked about him...

1087
01:24:31,320 --> 01:24:32,639
this Ego is bad news.

1088
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:34,438
We're here to save Quill.

1089
01:24:34,600 --> 01:24:38,639
For what? Huh?
For honor? For love?

1090
01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:41,792
No. I don't care about those things.

1091
01:24:41,960 --> 01:24:44,190
I wanna save Quill
so I can prove I'm better than him!

1092
01:24:44,360 --> 01:24:47,113
I can lord this over him forever.

1093
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:50,712
What are you laughing at me for?

1094
01:24:51,360 --> 01:24:56,070
You can fool yourself and everyone else,
but you can't fool me.

1095
01:24:56,240 --> 01:24:57,514
I know who you are.

1096
01:24:57,680 --> 01:24:59,830
You don't know anything
about me, loser.

1097
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,275
I know everything about you.

1098
01:25:02,840 --> 01:25:05,229
I know you play like
you're the meanest and the hardest...

1099
01:25:05,400 --> 01:25:07,196
but, actually,
you're the most scared of all.

1100
01:25:07,220 --> 01:25:07,920
Shut up!

1101
01:25:07,960 --> 01:25:10,315
I know you steal batteries
you don't need...

1102
01:25:10,480 --> 01:25:13,074
and you push away anyone
who's willing to put up with you...

1103
01:25:13,240 --> 01:25:14,656
because just a little bit of love...

1104
01:25:14,680 --> 01:25:18,256
reminds you how big and empty
that hole inside you actually is.

1105
01:25:18,360 --> 01:25:19,488
I said shut up!

1106
01:25:19,580 --> 01:25:23,152
I know them scientists what made you,
never gave a rat's ass about you.

1107
01:25:23,220 --> 01:25:24,439
I'm serious, dude!

1108
01:25:24,439 --> 01:25:27,399
Just like my own damn parents
who sold me...

1109
01:25:27,420 --> 01:25:29,397
their own little baby, into slavery.

1110
01:25:30,040 --> 01:25:32,470
I know who you are, boy.

1111
01:25:32,480 --> 01:25:34,471
Because you're me.

1112
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,070
What kind of a pair are we?

1113
01:25:44,400 --> 01:25:47,437
The kind that's about to
go fight a planet, I reckon.

1114
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:50,672
All right, okay! 
Good. Wait.

1115
01:25:51,200 --> 01:25:52,474
Fight a what?

1116
01:25:56,800 --> 01:25:57,800
Who are you people?

1117
01:25:58,120 --> 01:25:59,020
What is this place?

1118
01:25:59,040 --> 01:26:00,040
Gamora, let her go!

1119
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:02,436
The bodies in the caverns...
Who are they?

1120
01:26:02,800 --> 01:26:04,909
You are scared.

1121
01:26:08,440 --> 01:26:11,318
I call it the Expansion.

1122
01:26:12,440 --> 01:26:15,750
It is my purpose...

1123
01:26:15,920 --> 01:26:19,435
and now it is yours as well.

1124
01:26:20,320 --> 01:26:21,753
It's beautiful.

1125
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,275
Over thousands of years...

1126
01:26:25,440 --> 01:26:28,591
I implanted thousands
of extensions of myself...

1127
01:26:28,760 --> 01:26:31,479
on thousands of worlds.

1128
01:26:31,640 --> 01:26:35,428
I need to fulfill
life's one true purpose...

1129
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:37,477
To grow and spread...

1130
01:26:37,640 --> 01:26:40,757
covering all that exists...

1131
01:26:40,960 --> 01:26:44,999
until everything is...

1132
01:26:46,400 --> 01:26:47,400
Me!

1133
01:26:48,200 --> 01:26:50,430
What did she do to me?

1134
01:26:50,640 --> 01:26:52,232
She already told me everything.

1135
01:26:52,400 --> 01:26:54,960
I only had one problem.

1136
01:26:55,680 --> 01:26:58,672
A single Celestial
doesn't have enough power

1137
01:26:58,760 --> 01:27:00,716
for such an enterprise.

1138
01:27:00,880 --> 01:27:02,996
But two Celestials...

1139
01:27:03,160 --> 01:27:06,470
Well, now, that just might do.

1140
01:27:09,240 --> 01:27:10,593
The bodies...

1141
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:13,635
are his children.

1142
01:27:14,200 --> 01:27:15,394
<i>Out of all my labors...</i>

1143
01:27:15,920 --> 01:27:17,797
the most beguiling was...

1144
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:21,356
attempting to graft my DNA
with that of another species.

1145
01:27:21,520 --> 01:27:24,432
I hoped the result of such a coupling
would be enough...

1146
01:27:24,600 --> 01:27:26,431
to power the Expansion.

1147
01:27:27,520 --> 01:27:30,034
<i>I had Yondu deliver
some of them to me.</i>

1148
01:27:30,200 --> 01:27:33,590
<i>It broke the Ravager code,
but I compensated him generously...</i>

1149
01:27:33,760 --> 01:27:37,514
<i>and to ease his conscience,
I said I'd never hurt them.</i>

1150
01:27:37,680 --> 01:27:40,240
I mean, that was true.
They never felt a thing.

1151
01:27:40,440 --> 01:27:43,716
But one after the other, they failed me.

1152
01:27:43,880 --> 01:27:47,714
Not one of them carried
the Celestial genes.

1153
01:27:47,880 --> 01:27:49,029
Until you, Peter.

1154
01:27:50,360 --> 01:27:52,920
Out of all my spawn...

1155
01:27:53,120 --> 01:27:57,193
only you carried
the connection to the light.

1156
01:27:57,360 --> 01:28:00,238
We need to find Peter now,
and get off this damn planet.

1157
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:02,994
Ego will have won him
to his side by now.

1158
01:28:04,200 --> 01:28:05,599
- Then we just go.
- No!

1159
01:28:05,800 --> 01:28:07,930
- He's our friend.
- All any of you do...

1160
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,150
is yell at each other.
You are not friends.

1161
01:28:10,520 --> 01:28:11,873
You're right.

1162
01:28:12,400 --> 01:28:13,435
We're family.

1163
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:16,873
We leave no one behind.

1164
01:28:20,360 --> 01:28:21,634
Except maybe you.

1165
01:28:22,240 --> 01:28:23,719
Oh, my God.

1166
01:28:23,840 --> 01:28:25,910
For the first time in my existence...

1167
01:28:26,680 --> 01:28:29,592
I am truly not alone!

1168
01:28:35,060 --> 01:28:36,209
What is it, son?

1169
01:28:39,680 --> 01:28:40,829
My friends.

1170
01:28:42,200 --> 01:28:46,239
You see,
that's the mortal in you, Peter.

1171
01:28:46,760 --> 01:28:47,760
Yes.

1172
01:28:48,040 --> 01:28:51,012
We are beyond such things.

1173
01:28:51,080 --> 01:28:52,080
Yes.

1174
01:28:54,400 --> 01:28:55,628
- Now...
- But my mother...

1175
01:28:58,600 --> 01:29:00,909
You said you loved my mother.

1176
01:29:01,080 --> 01:29:02,593
And that I did.

1177
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:08,709
My river lily who knew all the words
to every song that came over the radio.

1178
01:29:10,520 --> 01:29:13,193
I returned to Earth
to see her three times.

1179
01:29:13,360 --> 01:29:15,874
And I knew if I returned a fourth...

1180
01:29:16,040 --> 01:29:17,598
I'd never leave.

1181
01:29:18,720 --> 01:29:20,278
The Expansion...

1182
01:29:21,680 --> 01:29:24,035
the reason for my very existence,
would be over.

1183
01:29:24,200 --> 01:29:26,236
So, I did what I had to do.

1184
01:29:29,040 --> 01:29:32,430
But it broke my heart
to put that tumor in her head.

1185
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:37,969
What?

1186
01:29:38,040 --> 01:29:39,298
Now, all right...

1187
01:29:39,360 --> 01:29:41,698
I know that sounds bad.

1188
01:29:53,240 --> 01:29:56,776
Who in the hell do you think you are?

1189
01:29:57,040 --> 01:29:58,598
You killed my mother!

1190
01:29:58,760 --> 01:29:59,795
I tried...

1191
01:29:59,960 --> 01:30:01,712
so hard...

1192
01:30:01,880 --> 01:30:03,359
to find the form...

1193
01:30:03,520 --> 01:30:05,909
that best suited you...

1194
01:30:06,080 --> 01:30:08,389
and this is the thanks I get?

1195
01:30:09,500 --> 01:30:12,289
You really need to grow up.

1196
01:30:16,780 --> 01:30:19,178
I wanted to do this together...

1197
01:30:19,240 --> 01:30:20,996
but I suppose you'll have to learn

1198
01:30:21,080 --> 01:30:24,390
by spending the next thousand years
as a battery!

1199
01:30:26,320 --> 01:30:27,992
Finally! Rocket?

1200
01:30:28,160 --> 01:30:30,993
Keep that transmitter nearby,
so I can find you.

1201
01:30:31,160 --> 01:30:34,157
We're in an old piece of construction
equipment Yondu once used...

1202
01:30:34,220 --> 01:30:35,936
<i>to slice open the Bank of A 'askavaria.</i>

1203
01:30:35,960 --> 01:30:36,960
Ego's unhinged.

1204
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:38,479
<i>I know. Get ready.</i>

1205
01:30:38,640 --> 01:30:39,914
Drop her, Kraglin.

1206
01:30:58,520 --> 01:30:59,669
No.

1207
01:31:10,840 --> 01:31:13,673
<i>My life, my love</i>

1208
01:31:13,840 --> 01:31:16,035
<i>My lady is the sea</i>

1209
01:31:18,200 --> 01:31:19,315
Peter...

1210
01:31:20,120 --> 01:31:22,315
this is the sea.

1211
01:31:24,400 --> 01:31:25,400
Oh...

1212
01:32:05,600 --> 01:32:07,192
Hey, there, jackass!

1213
01:32:17,520 --> 01:32:19,033
What is that thing?

1214
01:32:26,560 --> 01:32:28,391
Out of the way, dumber, smaller Groot!

1215
01:32:33,240 --> 01:32:35,913
I told you something didn't feel right.

1216
01:32:36,080 --> 01:32:38,389
"I told you so."
Just what I need to hear right now.

1217
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:40,232
Well, I came back, didn't I?

1218
01:32:40,880 --> 01:32:42,240
Because there's an unspoken thing.

1219
01:32:42,360 --> 01:32:44,430
There is no unspoken thing.

1220
01:32:44,600 --> 01:32:46,440
What are you doing?
You could've killed us all!

1221
01:32:46,920 --> 01:32:48,478
Uh... "Thank you, Rocket"?

1222
01:32:48,640 --> 01:32:49,834
We had it under control.

1223
01:32:50,040 --> 01:32:52,315
We did not.
That is only an extension...

1224
01:32:52,480 --> 01:32:54,516
of his true self.
He will be back soon.

1225
01:32:54,680 --> 01:32:55,954
What's Smurfette doing here?

1226
01:32:56,120 --> 01:32:58,031
Whatever I need to do to get
a damn ride home.

1227
01:32:58,200 --> 01:32:59,428
She tried to murder me!

1228
01:32:59,600 --> 01:33:01,591
I saved you, you stupid fox!

1229
01:33:01,800 --> 01:33:03,028
He's not a fox.

1230
01:33:03,200 --> 01:33:05,270
- I am Groot.
- I'm not a raboon, either.

1231
01:33:05,440 --> 01:33:06,440
I am Groot.

1232
01:33:06,640 --> 01:33:08,039
"Raccoon." Whatever.

1233
01:33:11,560 --> 01:33:12,879
How do we kill a Celestial?

1234
01:33:13,040 --> 01:33:14,473
There's a center to him.

1235
01:33:14,640 --> 01:33:16,756
His brain, his soul, whatever it is...

1236
01:33:16,840 --> 01:33:18,040
Some sort of protective shell.

1237
01:33:18,480 --> 01:33:19,515
It's in the caverns...

1238
01:33:19,680 --> 01:33:20,680
below the surface.

1239
01:33:23,360 --> 01:33:24,873
Yondu?

1240
01:33:33,560 --> 01:33:34,675
Thrusters are out.

1241
01:33:35,240 --> 01:33:37,071
Guess I should be glad
I was a skinny kid.

1242
01:33:37,240 --> 01:33:39,200
Otherwise, you'd have
delivered me to this maniac.

1243
01:33:39,240 --> 01:33:40,496
You still reckon that's the reason

1244
01:33:40,520 --> 01:33:41,680
I kept you around, you idiot?

1245
01:33:41,840 --> 01:33:43,440
That's what you told me, you old doofus.

1246
01:33:43,960 --> 01:33:46,080
Once I figured out
what happened to them other kids...

1247
01:33:46,200 --> 01:33:47,792
I wasn't just gonna hand you over.

1248
01:33:47,960 --> 01:33:49,552
You said you were gonna eat me.

1249
01:33:49,720 --> 01:33:51,119
That was being funny!

1250
01:33:51,960 --> 01:33:53,154
Not to me!

1251
01:33:53,320 --> 01:33:54,548
You people have issues.

1252
01:33:54,720 --> 01:33:56,438
Of course I have issues.

1253
01:33:57,400 --> 01:34:00,198
That's my freakin' father!

1254
01:34:00,400 --> 01:34:01,958
Thrusters are back up.

1255
01:34:15,560 --> 01:34:17,710
- We should be going up!
- We can't!

1256
01:34:17,920 --> 01:34:20,388
Ego wants to eradicate
the universe as we know it.

1257
01:34:20,560 --> 01:34:21,959
We have to kill him.

1258
01:34:22,120 --> 01:34:22,791
Rocket!

1259
01:34:22,960 --> 01:34:23,960
Got it!

1260
01:34:30,240 --> 01:34:32,674
Whoo-hoo!

1261
01:34:37,880 --> 01:34:39,711
So, we're saving the galaxy again?

1262
01:34:39,880 --> 01:34:40,915
I guess.

1263
01:34:41,080 --> 01:34:42,080
Awesome!

1264
01:34:44,240 --> 01:34:46,390
We're really gonna be able to
jack up our prices...

1265
01:34:46,560 --> 01:34:48,198
if we're two-time galaxy savers.

1266
01:34:48,360 --> 01:34:50,920
I seriously can't believe
that's where your mind goes.

1267
01:34:51,120 --> 01:34:53,839
It was just a random thought, man.
I thought we were friends.

1268
01:34:54,040 --> 01:34:56,280
Of course, I care about the planets,
and the buildings...

1269
01:34:56,440 --> 01:34:58,192
and all the animals on the planets.

1270
01:34:58,360 --> 01:34:59,554
And the people.

1271
01:34:59,720 --> 01:35:00,914
Meh.

1272
01:35:01,440 --> 01:35:05,479
The crabby puppy is so cute.
He makes me wanna die!

1273
01:35:43,240 --> 01:35:44,240
<i>Pilots...</i>

1274
01:35:44,400 --> 01:35:45,753
release envoy units.

1275
01:35:48,040 --> 01:35:52,079
<i>Our sensors detect the batteries
are below the surface of the planet.</i>

1276
01:35:53,960 --> 01:35:55,029
Dive!

1277
01:36:11,880 --> 01:36:13,359
Um... Captain?

1278
01:36:14,160 --> 01:36:15,559
<i>Captain?</i>

1279
01:36:20,920 --> 01:36:22,492
Tell me why Ego wants you here?

1280
01:36:22,720 --> 01:36:24,896
He needs my genetic connection
to the light...

1281
01:36:24,920 --> 01:36:26,915
to help destroy the universe.

1282
01:36:26,920 --> 01:36:29,070
He tried to teach me
how to control the power.

1283
01:36:29,240 --> 01:36:30,355
So, could you?

1284
01:36:30,720 --> 01:36:31,814
A little.

1285
01:36:31,880 --> 01:36:33,108
I made a ball.

1286
01:36:33,480 --> 01:36:34,380
A ball?

1287
01:36:34,440 --> 01:36:36,158
I thought as hard as I could.

1288
01:36:36,240 --> 01:36:37,798
It was all that I could come up with.

1289
01:36:37,960 --> 01:36:39,279
You "thought"?

1290
01:36:39,480 --> 01:36:41,350
You think when I make this arrow fly...

1291
01:36:41,420 --> 01:36:43,164
I use my head?

1292
01:36:55,040 --> 01:36:56,359
Whoa.

1293
01:37:05,120 --> 01:37:06,120
There.

1294
01:37:06,280 --> 01:37:08,236
That's Ego's core.

1295
01:37:10,600 --> 01:37:12,238
That ore is thick, Rocket.

1296
01:37:12,400 --> 01:37:14,038
I got it covered.

1297
01:37:20,520 --> 01:37:21,839
We must hurry.

1298
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,036
It will not take Ego long to find us.

1299
01:37:28,360 --> 01:37:29,554
Keep it steady.

1300
01:37:36,040 --> 01:37:37,996
We drill into the center, we kill him!

1301
01:37:44,520 --> 01:37:45,748
<i>Captain?</i>

1302
01:37:46,160 --> 01:37:47,195
What is it, Kraglin?

1303
01:37:47,360 --> 01:37:49,316
<i>Hey, remember that Ayesha chick?</i>

1304
01:37:49,880 --> 01:37:51,791
- Yeah, why?
<i>- Uh...</i>

1305
01:37:52,080 --> 01:37:53,274
Oh, hell!

1306
01:38:13,880 --> 01:38:15,472
Why aren't you firing the lasers?

1307
01:38:15,920 --> 01:38:17,638
They blew out the generator.

1308
01:38:17,800 --> 01:38:20,598
I think I packed a small detonator.

1309
01:38:20,760 --> 01:38:22,456
A detonator is worthless
without explosives.

1310
01:38:22,480 --> 01:38:23,959
Well, we got these.

1311
01:38:24,720 --> 01:38:26,756
Is that thing strong enough to kill Ego?

1312
01:38:26,960 --> 01:38:28,837
If it is, it'll cause a chain reaction...

1313
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:30,672
throughout his entire nervous system.

1314
01:38:30,880 --> 01:38:31,630
Meaning what?

1315
01:38:31,840 --> 01:38:33,353
The entire planet will explode.

1316
01:38:33,520 --> 01:38:34,953
We'll have to get out of here fast.

1317
01:38:35,120 --> 01:38:36,712
I rigged a timer.

1318
01:38:37,680 --> 01:38:38,749
Go!

1319
01:38:52,960 --> 01:38:54,678
He's coming.

1320
01:38:56,120 --> 01:38:57,838
Didn't you say
you could make him sleep?

1321
01:38:58,360 --> 01:39:00,749
When he wants.
He's too powerful.

1322
01:39:00,920 --> 01:39:02,239
I can't!

1323
01:39:02,760 --> 01:39:04,637
You don't have to believe in yourself...

1324
01:39:05,360 --> 01:39:07,396
because I believe in you.

1325
01:39:19,800 --> 01:39:20,800
Sleep!

1326
01:39:28,200 --> 01:39:29,840
I never thought she'd be able to do it...

1327
01:39:29,920 --> 01:39:32,150
with as weak and skinny
as she appears to be.

1328
01:39:33,080 --> 01:39:35,992
I don't know how long I can hold him.

1329
01:39:39,320 --> 01:39:40,992
The metal's too thick.

1330
01:39:41,200 --> 01:39:44,476
For the bomb to work, we'd actually
need to place it on Ego's core.

1331
01:39:44,640 --> 01:39:46,960
And our fat butts ain't gonna fit
through those tiny holes.

1332
01:39:47,600 --> 01:39:48,600
<i>Well...</i>

1333
01:39:51,400 --> 01:39:53,231
That's a terrible idea.

1334
01:39:53,400 --> 01:39:55,675
<i>Which is the only kind of idea
we have left.</i>

1335
01:39:56,680 --> 01:39:58,159
Unbelievable.

1336
01:39:58,320 --> 01:40:00,515
"Rocket, do this. Rocket, do that."

1337
01:40:02,120 --> 01:40:03,599
<i>What a day.</i>

1338
01:40:11,160 --> 01:40:14,755
All right, first you flick this switch,
then this switch.

1339
01:40:14,920 --> 01:40:16,069
That activates it.

1340
01:40:16,280 --> 01:40:18,077
Then you push this button...

1341
01:40:18,280 --> 01:40:21,317
which will give you five minutes
to get out of there.

1342
01:40:21,480 --> 01:40:22,754
Now, whatever you do...

1343
01:40:23,400 --> 01:40:25,789
don't push this button...

1344
01:40:25,960 --> 01:40:28,030
because that will set off
the bomb immediately

1345
01:40:28,120 --> 01:40:29,599
and we'll all be dead.

1346
01:40:29,720 --> 01:40:32,154
Now, repeat back what I just said.

1347
01:40:32,320 --> 01:40:33,992
- I am Groot.
- Uh-huh.

1348
01:40:34,280 --> 01:40:36,236
- I am Groot.
- That's right.

1349
01:40:36,400 --> 01:40:37,515
- I am Groot.
- No!

1350
01:40:37,960 --> 01:40:40,269
No, that's the button
that will kill everyone!

1351
01:40:40,440 --> 01:40:41,440
Try again.

1352
01:40:42,680 --> 01:40:43,829
Hmm...

1353
01:40:44,480 --> 01:40:46,232
- I am Groot.
- Mmm-hmm.

1354
01:40:46,480 --> 01:40:48,550
- I am Groot.
- Uh-huh.

1355
01:40:48,720 --> 01:40:49,720
I am Groot.

1356
01:40:49,800 --> 01:40:51,631
No! That's exactly what you just said!

1357
01:40:51,800 --> 01:40:53,392
How is that even possible?

1358
01:40:53,560 --> 01:40:55,790
Which button is the button
you're supposed to push?

1359
01:40:55,960 --> 01:40:57,029
Point to it.

1360
01:40:57,200 --> 01:40:58,200
No!

1361
01:40:58,520 --> 01:41:00,272
<i>Hey, you're making him nervous!</i>

1362
01:41:00,440 --> 01:41:02,192
Shut up and get me some tape!

1363
01:41:02,360 --> 01:41:03,840
Does anybody have any tape out there?

1364
01:41:03,880 --> 01:41:05,632
I wanna put some tape
over the death button.

1365
01:41:05,800 --> 01:41:08,678
I don't have any tape. Let me check.

1366
01:41:08,840 --> 01:41:11,513
<i>Yo, Yondu... Ow!</i>

1367
01:41:11,640 --> 01:41:13,790
<i>Do you have any tape?</i>

1368
01:41:16,120 --> 01:41:19,157
<i>Gamora? Do you have any tape?</i>

1369
01:41:19,320 --> 01:41:20,355
<i>Tape!</i>

1370
01:41:20,520 --> 01:41:22,954
<i>Never mind. Ow!</i>

1371
01:41:23,880 --> 01:41:26,394
<i>Drax, do you have any tape?</i>

1372
01:41:27,080 --> 01:41:29,353
<i>Yes, Scotch tape would work.</i>

1373
01:41:29,440 --> 01:41:31,400
<i>Then why did you ask me
if Scotch tape would work,</i>

1374
01:41:31,520 --> 01:41:32,999
<i>if you don't have any?</i>

1375
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:35,228
Nobody has any tape!

1376
01:41:35,440 --> 01:41:36,759
Not a single person has tape?

1377
01:41:37,160 --> 01:41:38,160
Nope!

1378
01:41:38,360 --> 01:41:39,475
Did you ask Nebula?

1379
01:41:40,360 --> 01:41:41,031
Yes!

1380
01:41:41,240 --> 01:41:42,514
Are you sure?

1381
01:41:42,680 --> 01:41:43,999
I asked Yondu...

1382
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,176
- and she was sitting next to him.
- I knew you were lying!

1383
01:41:46,400 --> 01:41:48,656
You have priceless batteries
and an atomic bomb in your bag.

1384
01:41:48,680 --> 01:41:51,069
If anybody's gonna have tape, it's you!

1385
01:41:51,240 --> 01:41:54,755
That's exactly my point!
I have to do everything!

1386
01:41:54,960 --> 01:41:57,428
You are wasting a lot of time here!

1387
01:41:59,920 --> 01:42:01,035
Whee!

1388
01:42:03,800 --> 01:42:05,711
We're all gonna die.

1389
01:42:07,440 --> 01:42:09,556
Rear thrusters are out again!

1390
01:42:09,800 --> 01:42:12,473
We're done for without that generator!

1391
01:42:25,840 --> 01:42:27,068
<i>Guardians...</i>

1392
01:42:27,880 --> 01:42:29,552
<i>perhaps it will provide you solace...</i>

1393
01:42:29,720 --> 01:42:32,314
<i>that your deaths
are not without purpose.</i>

1394
01:42:32,880 --> 01:42:34,438
<i>They will serve as a warning...</i>

1395
01:42:34,600 --> 01:42:36,989
to all of those tempted with betraying us.

1396
01:42:37,520 --> 01:42:40,318
Don't screw with the Sovereign.

1397
01:42:44,080 --> 01:42:45,149
This is gonna hurt.

1398
01:42:45,320 --> 01:42:46,833
Promises, promises.

1399
01:42:57,280 --> 01:42:58,280
Hey!

1400
01:43:09,920 --> 01:43:10,920
No!

1401
01:43:11,520 --> 01:43:13,636
No! No! No!

1402
01:43:19,120 --> 01:43:20,120
We're gonna blow!

1403
01:43:25,400 --> 01:43:27,311
Peter! No!

1404
01:43:47,240 --> 01:43:48,240
What?

1405
01:43:48,560 --> 01:43:50,551
You look like Mary Poppins.

1406
01:43:50,720 --> 01:43:52,119
Is he cool?

1407
01:43:53,920 --> 01:43:55,558
Hell, yeah, he's cool.

1408
01:43:56,320 --> 01:43:58,197
I'm Mary Poppins, y'all!

1409
01:44:25,640 --> 01:44:27,596
Mantis, look out!

1410
01:44:39,720 --> 01:44:41,312
She's just unconscious.

1411
01:44:57,360 --> 01:44:58,918
How long until the bomb goes off?

1412
01:44:59,080 --> 01:45:01,435
In the unlikely event
that Groot doesn't kill us all...

1413
01:45:01,600 --> 01:45:02,749
about six minutes.

1414
01:45:07,800 --> 01:45:10,314
Kraglin, we need the quadrant
for an extraction.

1415
01:45:10,480 --> 01:45:11,480
<i>T-minus five minutes.</i>

1416
01:45:11,640 --> 01:45:12,789
Aye, Captain.

1417
01:45:16,680 --> 01:45:18,560
Somebody's gotta be up top
when Kraglin arrives.

1418
01:45:19,840 --> 01:45:21,353
Drax, take Mantis.

1419
01:45:24,240 --> 01:45:25,514
Ow! My nipples!

1420
01:45:34,200 --> 01:45:35,394
Gamora!

1421
01:45:38,720 --> 01:45:39,755
Peter!

1422
01:46:06,080 --> 01:46:07,399
Get over it.

1423
01:46:07,880 --> 01:46:11,589
Come now, Peter.
I know this isn't what you want.

1424
01:46:13,760 --> 01:46:18,117
What kind of father would I be
to let you make this choice?

1425
01:46:47,680 --> 01:46:49,671
Yeah!

1426
01:46:49,760 --> 01:46:53,389
Soon, Peter, we will be all there is.

1427
01:46:54,080 --> 01:46:57,152
So stop pissing me off!

1428
01:47:17,400 --> 01:47:19,040
We have to get up
to the extraction point!

1429
01:47:27,160 --> 01:47:28,160
Go!

1430
01:49:27,560 --> 01:49:29,152
I told you...

1431
01:49:29,320 --> 01:49:33,154
I don't want to do this alone.

1432
01:49:36,360 --> 01:49:37,395
You cannot deny...

1433
01:49:37,520 --> 01:49:41,832
the purpose the universe
has bestowed upon you.

1434
01:49:51,080 --> 01:49:52,798
Everyone,
I need you to stay back!

1435
01:49:52,960 --> 01:49:53,960
What is that?

1436
01:50:09,720 --> 01:50:11,915
<i>It doesn't need to be
like this, Peter.</i>

1437
01:50:13,780 --> 01:50:16,772
Why are you destroying our chance?

1438
01:50:19,840 --> 01:50:22,957
<i>Stop pretending you aren't
what you are.</i>

1439
01:50:24,800 --> 01:50:25,800
<i>One in billions.</i>

1440
01:50:27,560 --> 01:50:29,391
<i>Trillions. Even more.</i>

1441
01:50:31,760 --> 01:50:36,117
What greater meaning
can life possibly have to offer?

1442
01:50:38,800 --> 01:50:42,873
I don't use my head to fly the arrow, boy!

1443
01:50:43,480 --> 01:50:45,357
I use my heart...

1444
01:51:20,600 --> 01:51:24,309
You shouldn't have killed my mom,
and squished my Walkman.

Groot, If you can hear me, hurry up!

1458
01:52:07,720 --> 01:52:10,757
I'm not sure how long Quill
can keep him distracted!

1459
01:53:08,760 --> 01:53:10,810
Yondu, we're about to blow!

1460
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:12,353
Get to the ship!

1461
01:53:12,520 --> 01:53:13,555
Not without Quill!

1462
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:15,877
You need to take care of the twig!

1463
01:53:17,240 --> 01:53:18,958
Not without you!

1464
01:53:20,200 --> 01:53:23,510
I ain't done nothin' right
my whole damn life, rat.

1465
01:53:26,880 --> 01:53:28,996
You need to give me this.

1466
01:53:37,240 --> 01:53:38,240
Uh...

1467
01:53:39,320 --> 01:53:41,788
A spacesuit and an aero-rig.

1468
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:44,070
I only have one of each.

1469
01:53:52,731 --> 01:53:53,731
I...

1470
01:53:56,400 --> 01:53:57,958
I am Groot.

1471
01:53:58,760 --> 01:53:59,829
What's that?

1472
01:54:01,560 --> 01:54:05,758
He says, 
"Welcome to the frickin' Guardians of the Galaxy."

1473
01:54:06,360 --> 01:54:08,635
Only he didn't use "frickin".

1474
01:54:15,060 --> 01:54:16,129
Bye, twig.

1475
01:54:17,960 --> 01:54:21,430
We're gonna need to have
a real discussion about your language.

1476
01:55:16,160 --> 01:55:17,160
Where's Peter?

1477
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:19,956
Rocket, where is he?

1478
01:55:20,680 --> 01:55:21,680
Rocket.

1479
01:55:21,840 --> 01:55:23,398
Rocket, look at me! Where is he?

1480
01:55:26,040 --> 01:55:27,040
Mmm...

1481
01:55:29,840 --> 01:55:32,195
No. I'm not leaving without him.

1482
01:55:39,200 --> 01:55:40,200
I'm sorry.

1483
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:43,798
I can only afford to lose
one friend today.

1484
01:55:44,360 --> 01:55:45,360
Kraglin, go!

1485
01:55:46,240 --> 01:55:47,240
Wait...

1486
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:49,558
Is Quill back?

1487
01:55:51,080 --> 01:55:53,514
Rocket, where's Quill?

1488
01:55:54,640 --> 01:55:57,916
Rocket, where's Quill?

1489
01:55:59,080 --> 01:56:00,308
<i>Rocket!</i>

1490
01:56:01,360 --> 01:56:02,360
<i>Where's Quill?</i>

1491
01:56:04,400 --> 01:56:06,311
<i>Where's Quill?</i>

1492
01:56:14,720 --> 01:56:16,870
No, we need to stop it.

1493
01:56:22,040 --> 01:56:23,075
Stop.

1494
01:56:23,880 --> 01:56:25,438
Stop. Listen to me!

1495
01:56:25,640 --> 01:56:27,153
You are a god.

1496
01:56:28,720 --> 01:56:30,073
If you kill me...

1497
01:56:30,240 --> 01:56:32,708
you'll be just like everybody else.

1498
01:56:33,840 --> 01:56:35,478
What's so wrong with that?

1499
01:56:35,640 --> 01:56:36,640
No!

1500
01:57:27,240 --> 01:57:29,390
He may have been your father, boy,

1501
01:57:29,520 --> 01:57:30,964
but he wasn't your daddy.

1502
01:57:35,360 --> 01:57:37,669
I'm sorry I didn't do none of it right.

1503
01:57:38,760 --> 01:57:41,035
I'm damn lucky you're my boy.

1504
01:57:44,800 --> 01:57:47,314
What?

1505
01:57:57,920 --> 01:57:59,069
Yondu, what are you doing?

1506
01:57:59,240 --> 01:58:00,355
You can't.

1507
01:58:01,002 --> 01:58:01,616
Nope.

1508
01:58:02,240 --> 01:58:03,240
Yondu!

1509
01:58:08,560 --> 01:58:09,993
No..

1510
01:58:14,600 --> 01:58:15,600
No!

1511
01:58:16,600 --> 01:58:18,192
Oh! Come on..

1512
01:58:18,880 --> 01:58:21,394
No! No!

1513
01:58:22,120 --> 01:58:24,031
Oh, no!

1514
01:59:18,880 --> 01:59:20,359
I told Gamora...

1515
01:59:20,480 --> 01:59:22,391
How when I was a kid I used to pretend

1516
01:59:22,480 --> 01:59:24,277
David Hasselhoff was my dad.

1517
01:59:27,200 --> 01:59:29,794
He's a singer and actor from Earth,
really famous guy.

1518
01:59:31,400 --> 01:59:33,197
Earlier, it struck me...

1519
01:59:34,440 --> 01:59:38,558
Yondu didn't have a talking car,
but he did have a flying arrow.

1520
01:59:39,160 --> 01:59:41,435
He didn't have
the beautiful voice of an angel...

1521
01:59:41,600 --> 01:59:43,875
but he did have the whistle of one.

1522
01:59:43,960 --> 01:59:47,509
Both Yondu and David Hasselhoff
went on kick-ass adventures...

1523
01:59:47,600 --> 01:59:50,160
and hooked up with hot women...

1524
01:59:50,320 --> 01:59:52,276
and fought robots.

1525
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:58,993
I guess David Hasselhoff did kind of
end up being my dad after all.

1526
01:59:59,160 --> 02:00:00,229
Only it was you, Yondu.

1527
02:00:06,920 --> 02:00:08,797
I had a pretty cool dad.

1528
02:00:11,800 --> 02:00:14,439
What I'm trying to say here is...

1529
02:00:15,440 --> 02:00:20,116
sometimes that thing
you're searching for your whole life...

1530
02:00:22,480 --> 02:00:24,789
it's right there by your side all along.

1531
02:00:24,960 --> 02:00:26,757
You don't even know it.

1532
02:00:38,880 --> 02:00:40,313
I am Groot.

1533
02:00:41,720 --> 02:00:43,472
He did call you twig.

1534
02:00:45,920 --> 02:00:47,239
Nebula...

1535
02:00:52,200 --> 02:00:54,156
I was a child like you.

1536
02:00:55,120 --> 02:00:59,193
I was concerned with staying alive
until the next day, every day.

1537
02:00:59,360 --> 02:01:02,318
And I never considered
what Thanos was doing to you.

1538
02:01:02,520 --> 02:01:04,238
I'm trying to make it right.

1539
02:01:04,440 --> 02:01:05,839
There are little girls like you...

1540
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:08,833
across the universe who are in danger.

1541
02:01:11,020 --> 02:01:12,499
You can stay with us and help them.

1542
02:01:13,680 --> 02:01:15,955
I will help them by killing Thanos.

1543
02:01:16,160 --> 02:01:18,196
I don't know if that's possible.

1544
02:01:33,120 --> 02:01:35,236
You will always be my sister.

1545
02:02:19,760 --> 02:02:20,760
Pete!

1546
02:02:24,240 --> 02:02:25,992
Captain found this for you
in a junker shop.

1547
02:02:26,160 --> 02:02:28,993
Said you'd come back
to the fold someday.

1548
02:02:30,800 --> 02:02:31,915
What is it?

1549
02:02:32,080 --> 02:02:33,080
It's called a Zune.

1550
02:02:33,280 --> 02:02:35,056
It's what everybody's listening to
on Earth nowadays.

1551
02:02:35,080 --> 02:02:36,672
It's got 300 songs on it.

1552
02:02:36,840 --> 02:02:39,115
300 songs?

1553
02:02:44,280 --> 02:02:45,349
Wait.

1554
02:02:51,480 --> 02:02:53,360
Rocket grabbed the pieces,
and reassembled them.

1555
02:02:53,520 --> 02:02:55,954
I think Yondu would want you to have it.

1556
02:02:59,360 --> 02:03:00,713
Thanks...

1557
02:03:02,560 --> 02:03:03,788
Captain.

What is it?

1568
02:04:27,360 --> 02:04:29,920
I sent word to
Yondu's old Ravager buddies,

1569
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:31,433
and told them what he did.

1570
02:04:35,200 --> 02:04:36,918
It's a Ravager funeral.

1571
02:04:54,320 --> 02:04:55,320
Yeah!

1572
02:04:55,920 --> 02:04:57,399
Yeah!

1573
02:05:04,760 --> 02:05:06,591
He didn't let us down after all, Captain.

1574
02:05:07,600 --> 02:05:09,352
No, he did not, son.

1575
02:05:10,360 --> 02:05:11,793
He did not.

1576
02:05:18,560 --> 02:05:21,791
Fare thee well, old friend.

1577
02:05:24,240 --> 02:05:28,916
Yondu Udonta, I will see you in the stars.

1578
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:34,956
He didn't chase them away.

1579
02:05:35,120 --> 02:05:36,235
No.

1580
02:05:37,280 --> 02:05:39,316
Even though he yelled at them.

1581
02:05:39,480 --> 02:05:40,993
And was always mean.

1582
02:05:43,640 --> 02:05:45,756
And he stole batteries he didn't need.

1583
02:05:51,400 --> 02:05:52,958
Well, of course not.

1584
02:06:17,160 --> 02:06:18,309
What?

1585
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:20,149
It's just...

1586
02:06:22,840 --> 02:06:25,434
some unspoken thing.

1587
02:06:34,640 --> 02:06:36,676
It's beautiful.

1588
02:06:38,160 --> 02:06:39,354
It is.

1589
02:06:40,880 --> 02:06:42,996
And so are you.

1590
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:46,228

1594

You know, it's a shame...

1595
02:08:43,600 --> 02:08:47,957
that it took the tragedy of losing Yondu
to bring us all together again.

1596
02:08:48,120 --> 02:08:51,317
But I think he'd be proud knowing
that we are back as a team.

1597
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:53,035
I'm in.

1598
02:08:53,240 --> 02:08:54,070
Dope.

1599
02:08:54,240 --> 02:08:56,310
I miss you guys so much!

1600
02:08:56,480 --> 02:08:57,674
Hell, yes.

1601
02:09:00,800 --> 02:09:02,711
What say we steal some shit?

1602
02:11:21,920 --> 02:11:23,797
High Priestess, the Council is waiting.

1603
02:11:25,080 --> 02:11:28,152
They are perturbed
I've wasted our resources.

1604
02:11:32,840 --> 02:11:35,798
When they see
what I have created here...

1605
02:11:35,960 --> 02:11:37,916
their wrath will dissipate.

1606
02:11:39,200 --> 02:11:42,192
It's a new type of birthing pod, ma'am?

1607
02:11:43,600 --> 02:11:44,794
That, my child...

1608
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:46,797
is the next step in our evolution.

1609
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:50,151
More powerful, more beautiful...

1610
02:11:50,320 --> 02:11:54,359
more capable of destroying
the Guardians of the Galaxy.

1611
02:11:57,040 --> 02:11:59,474
I think I shall call him...

Seriously?

1629
02:14:08,880 --> 02:14:10,880
You gotta clean up your room.
It's a complete mess.

1630
02:14:10,960 --> 02:14:12,359
I am Groot.

1631
02:14:12,560 --> 02:14:14,471
I am not boring. You're boring.

1632
02:14:14,640 --> 02:14:15,470
You know what's boring?

1633
02:14:15,640 --> 02:14:18,791
Sitting there,
playing that mind-numbing game.

1634
02:14:18,960 --> 02:14:22,555
What's boring is me tripping over
your vines every day!

1635
02:14:23,080 --> 02:14:24,308
I'm not boring!

1636
02:14:24,480 --> 02:14:25,480
I am Groot.

1637
02:14:27,160 --> 02:14:29,228
And now I know how Yondu felt.

1640
02:15:08,800 --> 02:15:10,836
just remember...

1641
02:15:11,480 --> 02:15:12,848
We

1642
02:15:12,849 --> 02:15:14,416
We Are

1643
02:15:14,417 --> 02:15:16,461
We Are Groot.

1644
02:15:18,800 --> 02:15:20,094
Hey, fellas.

1645
02:15:20,160 --> 02:15:21,832
Wait, where are you going?

1646
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:24,355
You were supposed to be my lift home.

1647
02:15:24,520 --> 02:15:26,192
How will I get out of here?

1648
02:15:26,360 --> 02:15:27,679
Hey! Aw, gee...

1649
02:15:27,760 --> 02:15:30,479
I've got so many more stories to tell.

1650
02:15:30,680 --> 02:15:31,874
Aw, guys.

1651
02:15:32,040 --> 02:15:34,349
Oh, gee...
