mlook.down@gmail.com
3
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:36,890
Things are never gonna 
be the same now.

4
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:40,880
I mean, look at this. 
We got aliens.

5
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:44,680
We got big, green guys 
tearing down buildings.

6
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:48,150
When I was a kid I used to 
draw cowboys and Indians.

7
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:50,250
Actually, it's Native 
American, but...

8
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:57,440
Yeah, tell you what, though...
Not bad, is it?

9
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:00,830
No, yeah. Kid's 
got a future.

10
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,840
Yeah, well...

11
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:06,310
We'll see, I guess.

12
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:34,490
No, hey... You can't saw 
through that stuff.

13
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:39,160
These alien bastards are tough. 
You gotta use the stuff they use.

14
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,600
See? All right.

15
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,080
Glad you could 
join us. Afternoon.

16
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,820
- My alarm's been going off...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Your alarm.

17
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:55,550
Look, just go stock that 
armor plating like I asked.

18
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:57,616
This is a huge deal for us.

19
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:02,120
Attention, please. In accordance 
with Executive order 396-B...

20
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:05,840
All post battle cleanup operations 
are now under our jurisdiction.

21
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:08,320
Thank you for your service. 
We'll take it from here.

22
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:11,256
- Who the hell are you?
- Qualified personnel.

23
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,600
Look, I have a city contract, to salvage 
all this, okay? With the city, so...

24
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:20,320
I apologize, Mr. Toomes. But all salvage 
operations are now under our jurisdiction.

25
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,740
Please turn over any and all exotic 
materials that you've collected,

26
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:26,650
- or you will be prosecuted.
- Ma'am, what are....

27
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:29,450
Please, wait up, come on.

28
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,520
Look...

29
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:34,660
I bought trucks for this job.

30
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:37,600
I've brought in a whole new 
crew. These guys have families.

31
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:40,486
I have a family. 
I'm all in on this.

32
00:02:40,511 --> 00:02:43,550
- I can lose my house!
- I'm sorry, sir. There's nothing I can do.

33
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:47,160
Maybe next time, 
don't overextend yourself.

34
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:51,100
What'd you say?

35
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:56,790
Yeah. He's right. I 
overextended myself.

36
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,480
Put them down.

37
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,810
If you have a grievance, you may 
take it up with my superiors.

38
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:09,700
Your superiors? Who 
the hell are they?!

39
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:12,210
The joint venture between Stark 
Industries and the federal government,

40
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,381
the Department of Damage Control,

41
00:03:14,406 --> 00:03:19,056
will oversee the collection and storage 
of alien and other exotic materials.

42
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:22,250
So now the assholes who made this 
mess are getting paid to clean it up?

43
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:25,631
- Yeah, it's all rigged.
- Experts estimate there are over

44
00:03:25,656 --> 00:03:29,480
1,500 tons of exotic materials 
scattered throughout the Tristate area.

45
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:33,520
Hey, Chief, we still have 
another load from yesterday.

46
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:36,020
- We're supposed to turn this in, right?
- I ain't hauling it.

47
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:40,520
It's too bad. We could've made some 
pretty cool stuff from all that alien junk.

48
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:46,960
I tell you what. Let's keep it.

49
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,440
The world's changing.

50
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:56,050
It's time we change, too.

51
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,680
Here you go, Mason.

52
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,720
Business is good.

53
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:31,780
New York, Queens.

54
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:33,900
It's a rough borough, 
but hey, it's home.

55
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,610
- Who are you talking to?
- No one.

56
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:39,857
- Just making a little video of the trip.
- You know you can't show it to anyone.

57
00:05:39,882 --> 00:05:42,040
- Yeah, I know.
- Then why are you narrating in that voice?

58
00:05:42,048 --> 00:05:45,406
- Hmm. Because it's fun.
- "Fun".

59
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:47,760
So, uhh, why do they call you "Happy"?

60
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,880
Come on. I'm not carrying 
your bags. Let's go.

61
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,670
Hey, should I go to 
the bathroom before?

62
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:59,120
- There's a bathroom on it.
- Woah, no pilot? That's awesome!

63
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,880
- Is that where you're gonna sit?
- Yeah.

64
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:05,536
- Is it your first time on a private plane?
- It's my first time on any plane.

65
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,560
Should it be making that noise?

66
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,480
No one has actually told me why 
I'm in Berlin. Or what I'm doing.

67
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:24,960
Something about, Captain 
America going crazy...

68
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,040
- This is you.
- Oh, we're neighbors?

69
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,120
We're not roommates. Suit up.

70
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:31,440
- Okay, Peter. You got this.
- What the hell are you wearing?

71
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,740
- It's my suit.
- Where's the case?

72
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,960
What case?

73
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:38,560
That's not my-- what? I thought that 
was a closet. This is still my room?

74
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,656
My room is way bigger than I...

75
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,760
Hey, I found the case.

76
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,200
"A minor upgrade"?

77
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:47,830
Woah! Oh, my God!

78
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:49,956
Put it on.

79
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:51,980
This is the coolest 
thing I've ever seen, ever!

80
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:55,890
- Let's go!
- But, I don't understand, is--- is it for me?

81
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:57,990
Happy, Happy, wait!

82
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:02,506
This is insane! Insane! Look 
at this thing! Look at the eyes!

83
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:04,530
- This is the greatest day of my life.
- Let's go.

84
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,000
Okay. There's Captain America,
 Iron Man, Black Widow...

85
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,040
- Woah, who's that new guy?
- Underoos!

86
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:12,050
That's me! I gotta 
go, I gotta go!

87
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,120
Hey, everyone.

88
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,040
Okay, so the craziest thing just happened, right? I just 
had a fight with Captain America and I stole his shield,

89
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,160
and I threw it at him, 
and I... What the hell...

90
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,120
He's big now! I 
gotta go. Hang on.

91
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:31,140
It was, the most amazing thing that's ever 
happened. So Mr. Stark's like: "Hey, Underoos!"

92
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:33,200
And I just sort of flipped in, 
and I stole Cap's shield,

93
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,200
and I was like, 
"Hey, what's up, everybody?"

94
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:37,480
Hey, just a second. Coming.

95
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:43,040
- Hey!
- We have thin walls here.

96
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:47,360
- What are you doing, a little video diary?
- Yeah.

97
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:51,680
- It's alright.
- I told him not to do it. He was filming everything.

98
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,680
Hey, hey, hey...

99
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,280
You know what, we should make 
an alibi video for your aunt, anyway.

100
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,360
You ready?

101
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,850
Okay. Get in the frame.

102
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:03,840
Hey, May. How are you doing? What are 
you wearing? Something skimpy, I hope.

103
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,616
Peter, that's inappropriate. 
Let's start over. We can edit it.

104
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:10,920
3, 2, 1. Hey, May! My gosh...

105
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:14,560
Wanted to tell you what an 
incredible job your nephew did...

106
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:19,000
this weekend at the 
Stark Internship retreat.

107
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:22,536
- Everyone was impressed.
- Come on!

108
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,320
- It's a friggin' merge, I'm sorry.
- This, 'cause you're not on Queens Boulevard.

109
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:28,530
See, Happy is hoping to get 
bumped up to Asset Management.

110
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:31,280
He was forehead of security. And 
before that, he was just a driver.

111
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,280
That was a private conversation.

112
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:36,100
I don't like joking about this. It was hard 
for me to talk to you about that...

113
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:39,570
- No seriously, was he snoring aboard the plane?
- Okay, here we go...

114
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:43,540
- Happy, can you give us a moment?
- You want me to leave the car?

115
00:08:43,565 --> 00:08:46,267
I want you to grab Peter's 
case out of the trunk.

116
00:08:46,292 --> 00:08:48,349
I can keep the suit?

117
00:08:48,374 --> 00:08:51,403
Yes, we were just talking about it.

118
00:08:51,428 --> 00:08:53,826
Do me a favor, though...

119
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:56,200
Happy's kinda your point guy in 
this. Don't stress him out.

120
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,840
Don't do anything stupid. 
I've seen his cardiogram.

121
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:01,236
- All right?
- Yes.

122
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:04,280
Don't do anything I would do. And 
definitely don't do anything I wouldn't do.

123
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:08,160
There's a little gray area in there 
and that's where you operate.

124
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,160
- Wait, does that mean that I'm an Avenger?
- No.

125
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,720
- He's at?
- Seventh floor.

126
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,524
- I can take that up. You don't have to take it.
- You're gonna take it?

127
00:09:15,549 --> 00:09:17,920
- Yeah. I can take that.
- Thank you.

128
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:23,100
- So, when's our next, "retreat", you know?
- What? Next mission?

129
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,120
- Yeah, the mission, the mission.
- We'll call you.

130
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,040
- Well did you have my number?
- No, I mean we'll call you.

131
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,240
Like, someone will 
call you. Alright?

132
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:34,180
That's not a hug, I'm just 
grabbing the door for you.

133
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,320
We're not--- we're not there yet.

134
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:40,430
Bye!

135
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,320
They're gonna call me.

136
00:10:36,733 --> 00:10:38,733
What's up, Penis Parker?

137
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:46,240
- Rise and shine, Midtown Science and Technology.
- Students, don't forget about your homecoming tickets.

138
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,320
- Do you have a date for homecoming?
- Thanks, Jason, but I already have a date.

139
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,320
- Okay.
- Yep.

140
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,400
You, in my office, right now!

141
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:25,940
Join me, and together, we'll 
build my new Lego Death Star.

142
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:27,940
- What?!
- So lame.

143
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,240
No way, that's awesome! 
How many pieces?

144
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,240
3,803.

145
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:34,256
- That's insane.
- I know!

146
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:37,660
- You wanna build it tonight?
- I can't tonight. I got the Stark internship.

147
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,976
- Stark internship.
- Yeah, exactly.

148
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,520
- Boy's got that internship.
- Hopefully, soon it'll lead to a real job.

149
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:48,040
That would be so sweet. He'd be all,

150
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,040
"Good job on those spreadsheets, 
Peter. Here's a gold coin."

151
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:53,510
- I don't know how jobs work.
- That's exactly how they work.

152
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:58,060
I'll knock out the basic bones of the Death 
Star at my place, and then I'll come by afterwards.

153
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:00,720
Because for the most part, the 
difficult thing will be just the base of it.

154
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,360
The top half will....

155
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:07,780
That'd be great.

156
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:13,360
Okay, so how do we calculate linear 
acceleration between points A and B?

157
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,480
Flash.

158
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,980
It's the product of sine of the 
angle and gravity, divided by the mass.

159
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:20,186
Nope. Peter.

160
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:22,216
Are you still with us?

161
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,000
Uh, yeah. Yeah. Uhh...

162
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:30,000
Mass cancels out, so 
it's just gravity times sine.

163
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:32,150
Right. See, Flash? 
Being the fastest

164
00:12:32,175 --> 00:12:34,184
isn't always the best 
if you are wrong.

165
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,280
You're dead.

166
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,776
Today we're gonna be talking 
about Danish physicist Neils Bohr.

167
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:49,840
But trust me, there's nothing "Bohr-ing" about 
his discoveries regarding quantum theory.

168
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,360
Did Liz get a new top?

169
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:04,920
No. We've seen that before, but...

170
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,920
- never with that skirt.
- Liz!

171
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,936
Hey! That looks so good.

172
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:11,720
We should probably stop staring 
before it gets creepy, though.

173
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:15,370
Too late. You guys are losers.

174
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:19,030
- Then why do you sit with us?
- 'Cause I don't have any friends.

175
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:26,420
Let's move to the next question: What 
is the heaviest naturally occuring element?

176
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:30,590
Hydrogen's the lightest. 
That's not the question. Ok.

177
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:34,000
- Uranium.
- That is correct. Thank you, Abraham.

178
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,156
Please open your books to page 10.

179
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:38,180
Peter, it's nationals. 
Is there no way

180
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:40,300
you could take 
one weekend off?

181
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:43,140
I can't go to Washington 
because if Mr. Stark needs me,

182
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:47,380
- then I have to make sure I'm here.
- You've never even been in the same room as Tony Stark.

183
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:50,399
- Wait, what's happening?
- Peter's not going to Washington.

184
00:13:50,424 --> 00:13:52,986
- No, no, no, no, no.
- Why not?

185
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:55,036
Really? Right before nationals?

186
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:57,180
You already quit marching
band and robotics lab.

187
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:01,300
I'm not obsessed with him. 
I'm just very observant.

188
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:03,520
Flash, you're in for Peter.

189
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:06,260
Oof. I don't know. I gotta 
check my calendar first.

190
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:10,280
- I got a hot date with Black Widow coming up.
- That is false.

191
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,850
What did I tell you about using 
the bell for comedic purposes?

192
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:31,940
- Hey, what's up?
- Hey, man.

193
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:36,620
- What's up, Mr. Delmar?
- Hey, Mr. Parker.

194
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:38,676
Number five, right?

195
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:41,780
Yeah, and with pickles. And can 
you squish it down real flat?

196
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:43,996
- Thanks.
- You got it, boss.

197
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:47,676
- How's your aunt?
- She's all right.

198
00:14:55,650 --> 00:14:57,790
- You know what? $10.
- It's $5!

199
00:14:57,790 --> 00:15:00,970
- For that comment, $10.
- Hey. Come on, I'm joking. I'm joking.

200
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:04,420
Here's $5.

201
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,980
What's up, Murph?

202
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:09,260
How you doing, buddy?

203
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:14,586
- How's school?
- Y'know. It's boring. I got better things to do.

204
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:18,060
Stay in school, kids. Stay in school. 
Otherwise, you're gonna end up like me.

205
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:21,570
- This is great.
- Best sandwiches in Queens.

206
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:33,300
Finally.

207
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:41,730
Hey, could you hold 
this for a second? Thanks.

208
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:45,156
Hey, is this anybody's bike? No?

209
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:47,756
- Hey, buddy, is this your bike?
- No change.

210
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:49,860
Does anyone have a pen, 
do you have a pen?

211
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:56,540
Everybody good?

212
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:06,360
Hey, you're that Spider-guy 
on YouTube, right?

213
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,540
- Call me Spider-Man!
- Okay, Spider-Man. Do a flip!

214
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:13,980
- Yeah!
- Not bad.

215
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:31,980
- You shouldn't steal cars. It's bad.
- It's my car, dumbass!

216
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:35,940
- Hey! Shut that off!
- I was just trying to---

217
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:38,220
- Yo! I work at night, come on, dude!
- That's not your car. That's his car.

218
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:41,380
How was I supposed to know it's his car? 
What's he doing with the window?

219
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:43,620
Everyday with these 
damn alarms. Turn it off.

220
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:46,310
Don't make me come 
down there, you punk.

221
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:50,956
- Hey, Gary! How you doing?
- Marjorie! How are you?

222
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:52,980
How's your mother?

223
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:00,660
I'm good.
I'm good.

224
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:04,806
You have reached the voice 
mailbox of Happy Hogan.

225
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:06,980
Hey, Happy. Here's my 
report for the night.

226
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:09,140
I stopped a grand theft bicycle. 
I couldn't find the owner

227
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:11,140
so I just left a note.

228
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:14,430
I helped this lost, 
old Dominican lady.

229
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:16,950
She was really nice and 
bought me a churro.

230
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:21,100
I just, feel like I could 
be doing more, you know.

231
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,280
I'm just curious when our 
next real mission's gonna be.

232
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:26,700
So yeah, just call me back.

233
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,940
It's Peter. Parker.

234
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:36,420
Why would I tell him 
about the churro?

235
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:53,180
Finally, something good.

236
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:58,100
Yo, this high tech 
stuff makes it too easy.

237
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:00,460
- Told you it was worth it.
- Go, go, go!

238
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:09,500
Woah. Nice. We can hit 
like 5 more places tonight.

239
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:23,100
What's up, guys? 
Forgot your PIN number?

240
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:27,460
You're the Avengers! 
What are you guys doing here?

241
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:32,700
Thor. Hulk. Good 
to finally meet you guys.

242
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,120
Thought he'd be more 
handsome in person.

243
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:37,340
Iron Man! What are you doing 
robbing banks? You're a billionaire.

244
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:45,100
This feels so weird!

245
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:49,150
What is that thing?

246
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:53,260
I'm starting, to think, 
you're not, the Avengers!

247
00:19:57,450 --> 00:19:59,550
911, what's your emergency?

248
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:04,040
Spider-Man is fighting the 
Avengers in a bank on 21st street.

249
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,540
Alright, guys. Let's wrap 
this up, it's a school night.

250
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,890
So how did jerks like 
you get tech like this?

251
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,820
Mr. Delmar.

252
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:27,420
Hey, Mr. Delmar, you in here? 
Is anybody in here? Hello?

253
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,120
Oh, come on.

254
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:41,860
I got him...

255
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:44,080
Here.

256
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:48,050
Okay. Good. Yes. No, no.

257
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:51,620
Put that down. That's worth 
more than you or me.

258
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:54,540
- Yeah?
- Happy, the craziest thing just happened to me!

259
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,910
- These guys were robbing an ATM with these high tech weapons, and then...
- Hey, take a breath.

260
00:20:57,060 --> 00:21:01,516
Okay? I don't have time for ATM, robberies, 
or the thoughtful notes you leave behind.

261
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:03,560
I have moving day 
to worry about.

262
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,760
Everything's gotta be 
out of here by next week.

263
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:09,056
- Wait, wait. You're moving? Who's moving?
- Dude, don't you watch the news?

264
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:13,180
Tony sold Avengers Tower. We're relocating 
to a new facility upstate, where hopefully,

265
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:15,340
the cell service is much worse.

266
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:17,420
- But what about me?
- What about you?

267
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:20,386
What if Mr. Stark needs me, 
or something big goes down?

268
00:21:20,411 --> 00:21:23,576
Can I please just 
talk to Mr. Stark?

269
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:28,060
Just stay away from anything too dangerous. I'm 
responsible for making sure you're responsible. Okay?

270
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:32,556
I am responsible! Crap... 
My backpack's gone.

271
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:34,770
- That doesn't sound responsible.
- I'll call you back.

272
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:37,380
Feel free not to.

273
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:41,610
- What was that?
- That's nothing! Nothing!

274
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:45,466
- You're the Spider-Man. From YouTube.
- I'm not. I'm not!

275
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:48,060
- You were on the ceiling!
- No, I wasn't. 

276
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:50,140
Ned, what are you doing in my room?

277
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:52,140
Aunt May let me in. You said we 
were gonna finish the Death Star!

278
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:54,216
You can't just bust into my room.

279
00:22:54,235 --> 00:22:58,420
That turkey meat loaf recipe is a 
disaster. Let's go to dinner. Thai, Ned?

280
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:01,756
- You want thai?
- No. He's got a thing.

281
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:03,780
A thing to do, after.

282
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:06,390
Okay.

283
00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:08,930
Maybe put on some clothes.

284
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:12,740
- She doesn't know?
- Nobody knows.

285
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:15,060
Mr. Stark knows, 'cause he 
made my suit. But that's it.

286
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:17,180
Tony Stark made you that?

287
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:19,250
Are you an Avenger?

288
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,640
Yeah. Basically.

289
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:25,460
You can't tell anybody about this. 
You gotta keep it a secret.

290
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,500
- A secret, why?
- If she finds out

291
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:30,740
people try and kill me every single night, 
she's not gonna let me do this anymore.

292
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:33,976
- C'mon Ned. Please.
- Okay. Okay, okay, okay.

293
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,351
I'll level with you. I don't think I can keep this a secret. 
This is the greatest thing that's ever happened to me, Peter!

294
00:23:37,376 --> 00:23:40,707
May cannot know. I cannot 
do that to her right now.

295
00:23:40,732 --> 00:23:44,676
You know? With everything 
that's happened with her, I...

296
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:46,792
Please.

297
00:23:47,317 --> 00:23:49,456
Okay.

298
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:51,480
Just swear it. Okay?

299
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:53,760
- I swear.
- Thank you.

300
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,900
I can't believe this is 
happening right now.

301
00:23:55,990 --> 00:23:58,056
- Can I try the suit on? How's it work?
- No.

302
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:00,626
- Is it magnets? How do you shoot the strings?
- I'm gonna tell you about this at school tomorrow. Okay?

303
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:03,316
Great. Wait, then...

304
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:08,300
How do you do this, and 
the Stark internship?

305
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:11,660
This is the Stark internship.

306
00:24:11,746 --> 00:24:15,300
Just get out.

307
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:21,560
What's the matter? 
I thought you loved larb.

308
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:25,710
It's too larby? Not larby enough.

309
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:31,160
How many times do I have to 
say 'larb' before, you talk to me?

310
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:33,296
You know I 'larb' you.

311
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:36,560
I'm just stressed. The internship, 
and I'm tired. A lotta work.

312
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,880
The Stark internship? 
I have to tell you...

313
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:42,180
Not a fan of that Tony Stark.

314
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:44,240
Distracted all the time...

315
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:48,720
It's got you in your head.

316
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,360
...in local news, the beloved Queens institution, 
Delmar Sandwiches was destroyed in an

317
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,920
explosion earlier tonight, 
after an ATM robbery was

318
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:56,220
thwarted by Queens 
own colorful, local

319
00:24:56,245 --> 00:24:59,656
crime-stopper, the Spider-Man. 
As the Spider-Man

320
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:02,200
attempted to foil their heist,
a powerful blast was set off,

321
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:06,160
slicing through the 
bodega across the street.

322
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:08,480
Miraculously, no one was harmed.

323
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:12,160
You spot something like that happening, 
you turn and you run the other way.

324
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:14,400
Yeah. Of course.

325
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:18,240
- Six blocks away from us!
- I need a new backpack.

326
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,116
- What?
- I need a new backpack.

327
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:24,140
That's a five.

328
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:27,066
- Sticky rice pudding.
- Oh, we didn't order that.

329
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:30,980
- It's on the house.
- Oh. Thanks.

330
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:34,550
That's nice of him.

331
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,480
I think, he 'larbs' you.

332
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:42,556
You got bit by a spider? 
Can it bite me?

333
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:44,616
It probably wouldn't hurt, right?

334
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:48,000
Y'know what, whatever. Even if it did hurt, I'll 
let it bite me. Maybe. How much did it hurt?

335
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,320
The spider's dead, Ned.

336
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:01,330
You were here?

337
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Yeah.

338
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:06,370
You could've died.

339
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:12,740
- Do you lay eggs?
- What? No.

340
00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:17,816
- Can you spit venom?
- No.

341
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:21,616
- Can you summon an army of spiders?
- No, Ned.

342
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:24,520
The Sokovia Accords were 
put into place, and...

343
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,720
How far can you shoot your webs?

344
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:28,980
Don't know. Shut up.

345
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:31,640
If I was you, I would stand on 
the edge of a building and just

346
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,656
shoot it as far as I can...

347
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,680
Shut up, Ned.

348
00:26:36,050 --> 00:26:38,804
Hi. I'm Captain America. Whether you're 
in the classroom, or on the battlefield...

349
00:26:38,829 --> 00:26:40,872
- Do you know him, too?
- Yeah. We've met.

350
00:26:40,897 --> 00:26:43,996
I stole his shield.

351
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:47,040
Today, my good friend, 
your gym teacher,

352
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:49,770
will be conducting the 
"Captain America Fitness Challenge."

353
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,896
Thank you, Captain. I'm pretty sure 
this guy's a war criminal now

354
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:55,560
but whatever. I have to show these videos, 
it's required by the state. Let's do it.

355
00:26:55,610 --> 00:26:57,886
Do Avengers have to pay taxes?

356
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:00,620
What does Hulk smell like? 
I bet he smells nice.

357
00:27:00,645 --> 00:27:03,216
- Ned, shut up.
- Is Captain America cool?

358
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:06,080
- Or is he like a mean, old grandpa?
- Ned, just shh. Okay?

359
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,080
Hey...

360
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:11,856
- Can I be your guy in the chair?
- What?

361
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:16,440
You know how there's a guy, with a headset, 
telling the other guy where to go? Like...

362
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:19,660
Like if you're stuck in an apartment building, I could tell 
you where to go, 'cause there'd be screens around me...

363
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:22,400
And I could swivel around them 'cause 
I'd be your guy in the chair.

364
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:25,920
- Ned, I don't need a guy in the chair.
- Looking good, Barker.

365
00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:31,440
Now see, for me, 
it would be, F Thor...

366
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:34,830
Marry Iron Man and kill Hulk.

367
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,080
- Well what about the Spider-Man?
- It's just Spider-Man.

368
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:41,620
And did you guys see that security cam 
on YouTube? He fought off 4 guys!

369
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:43,640
- Oh, my gosh. She's crushing on Spider-Man.
- No way.

370
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:46,320
- Kind of!
- Ugh. Gross.

371
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:50,256
- He's probably like, 30.
- You don't even know what he looks like.

372
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:52,360
What if he's like, seriously burned?

373
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:55,240
I wouldn't care. I would still love 
him for the person he is inside.

374
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:57,420
Peter knows Spider-Man.

375
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:04,626
- No, I don't. No. I mean...
- They're friends.

376
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:07,160
Yeah, like Coach Wilson and 
Captain America are friends.

377
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:11,080
I've met him. Yeah. A couple 
of times. But it's, umm...

378
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:14,960
Through the Stark internship.

379
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,800
Yeah. I'm not really 
supposed to talk about it.

380
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:23,220
Well that's awesome! Hey, you know what? 
Maybe you should invite him to Liz' party, right?

381
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:25,700
Yeah, I'm having people over tonight. 
You're more than welcome to come.

382
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:28,440
- You're having a party?
- Yeah. It's gonna be dope.

383
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:31,880
You should totally invite your 
personal friend Spider-Man.

384
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:34,596
It's okay. I know Peter's way

385
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:37,280
too busy for parties anyway, so...

386
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:39,510
Aw, c'mon. He'll be 
there. Right, Parker?

387
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,400
- What are you doing?
- Helping you out.

388
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:52,440
Did you not hear her? 
Liz has a crush on you.

389
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:58,060
Dude, you're an Avenger. If 
any one of us has a chance with

390
00:28:58,410 --> 00:29:00,910
a senior girl, it's you.

391
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:08,420
House party in the suburbs! 
I remember these.

392
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:11,320
- I'm kinda jealous!
- It'll be a night to remember.

393
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:13,320
Aww... Ned...

394
00:29:14,010 --> 00:29:16,900
Some hats wear men. 
You wear that hat.

395
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:18,900
Yeah. It gives me confidence.

396
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,856
This is a mistake. 
Hey, let's just go home.

397
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:26,480
Oh, Peter. I know. I know it's 
really hard, trying to fit in.

398
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:29,760
With all the changes your body is 
going through. It's flowering now.

399
00:29:32,627 --> 00:29:34,930
He's so stressed out lately.

400
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:38,000
What helps with stress, is going to 
a party. And you should have a party.

401
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:40,160
Yeah. I'm gonna go. I'm gonna go.

402
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,896
- Peter! Have fun. Okay?
- I will.

403
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:48,080
Bye, May!

404
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,680
Dude, you have the suit, right?

405
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,760
This is gonna change our lives!

406
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:12,160
We're gonna have Spider-Man swing in, 
say you guys are tight, and then I get...

407
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:14,640
a fist bump for one of 
those half bro bumps.

408
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:17,080
I can't believe you guys 
are at this lame party.

409
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,400
You're here, too.

410
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:21,610
Am I?

411
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:25,846
Oh, my gosh. Hey, guys! 
Cool hat, Ned.

412
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:27,996
- Hi, Liz!
- Hi, Liz.

413
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:30,760
I'm so happy you guys came.

414
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,840
There's pizza, and drinks. 
Help yourself.

415
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:36,840
- What a great party.
- Thanks.

416
00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:43,680
- My parents will kill me if anything's broken. I gotta...
- Yeah. 

417
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,239
- Have fun.
- Bye.

418
00:30:46,264 --> 00:30:49,546
Dude! What are you doing?

419
00:30:49,570 --> 00:30:51,570
She's here. Spider-Man up!

420
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:54,840
No, no, no. I cannot do this.

421
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:57,040
Spider-Man's not a party trick. 
Okay? Look, I'm just gonna...

422
00:30:57,370 --> 00:31:00,240
Be myself.

423
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,600
- Peter, no one wants that.
- Dude.

424
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,760
Penis Parker!

425
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:09,720
What's up? So where's 
your pal Spider-Man?

426
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:12,360
Let me guess. He's stranded 
with your imaginary girlfriend?

427
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:17,240
That's not Spider-Man. That's 
just Ned in a red shirt.

428
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:27,740
Hey, what's up? I'm Spider-Man.

429
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,880
Just thought I'd swing by 
and say hello to my boy Peter.

430
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:34,240
Oh, what's up, Ned? Hey, where's 
Peter anyway? He must be over...

431
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:42,720
God, this is stupid. What am I doing?

432
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,720
What the hell?

433
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:25,120
Now this is crafted from a reclaimed 
sub-Ultron arm straight from Sokovia.

434
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,500
Here. You try.

435
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:31,260
Man, I wanted something low-key, like... 
Why you tryin' to outsell me, man?

436
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,699
Ok, ok, ok. I got what you need, alright? 
I got tons of great stuff here.

437
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,720
One sec.

438
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:41,960
- Okay. I got, black hole grenades, Chitauri rail guns...
- ... Letting off shots in public.

439
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:44,040
No, I hear you. Look, 
times are changing, and

440
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:47,920
we're the only ones selling 
these high tech weapons.

441
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:51,040
This must be where the ATM 
robbers got their stuff.

442
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:55,826
I just need something to stakeout somebody. 
I'm not trying to shoot them back in time.

443
00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:59,200
- I got anti-grav climbers...
- You have climbers?

444
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,480
Okay, what the hell was that?

445
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:07,520
- Did you set us up?
- Hey, hey, man!

446
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,830
Hey, hey. C'mon! You're gonna 
shoot at somebody, shoot at me!

447
00:33:13,770 --> 00:33:15,770
All right.

448
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,640
What was that?

449
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:43,600
- We gotta call him.
- Nah, nah, nah, nah!

450
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:52,286
- Did you just do it again?
- Shut up!

451
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:54,310
I'm calling him.

452
00:34:01,770 --> 00:34:04,274
Toomes' phone.

453
00:34:04,599 --> 00:34:06,636
Boss...

454
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:08,660
Oww. My butt.

455
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:30,060
Great. Guess I'm gonna 
have to take a shortcut.

456
00:34:32,830 --> 00:34:34,830
Hey, guys. Good game. Have fun.

457
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:39,300
Hey! Buddy! Sorry, no time 
to play. Here. Go fetch!

458
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:43,540
Now this is more like it!

459
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:58,460
Smells really good!

460
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:03,740
Great movie!

461
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:11,100
Oh, hey guys.

462
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:18,176
- Hey, it's Peter. Leave a message.
- Peter, where are you?

463
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,500
The hat's not working. This is not cool.

464
00:35:21,390 --> 00:35:23,390
Almost got ya!

465
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,300
Thought you'd get away 
from me, didn't you?

466
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:40,580
I gotcha! Right 
where I want you!

467
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:42,820
Surprise!

468
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:48,620
What the hell?

469
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:37,780
Oh. Hey.

470
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:43,520
And then, he's, he just, like swooped down, 
like a monster. And he picked me up...

471
00:36:43,610 --> 00:36:47,550
and took me over like 1000 
feet and just dropped me.

472
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:50,290
How did you find me? Did you put 
a tracker on my suit or something?

473
00:36:50,290 --> 00:36:52,290
I put everything in your suit.

474
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,500
Including this heater.

475
00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:01,116
- That's better. Thanks.
- What were you thinking?

476
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:04,360
The guy with the wings is obviously the 
source of the weapons. I gotta take him down.

477
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:06,456
Take him down now, huh?

478
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:10,260
- Steady, Crockett. There are people who handle this sort of thing.
- The Avengers?

479
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:12,710
No, no, no. This is a little 
below their paygrade.

480
00:37:12,810 --> 00:37:16,060
Anyway, Mr. Stark. You didn't have to come 
all the way out here. I had that. I was fine.

481
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:19,020
Oh, I'm not... here.

482
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:24,140
Thank God, this place has Wi-Fi, 
or you would be toast right now.

483
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,240
Thank Ganesh while you're at it.

484
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:30,226
- Look, forget the flying Vulture guy. Please!
- Why?

485
00:37:30,251 --> 00:37:32,820
Why? Because I said so!

486
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,420
Sorry. I'm talking to a teenager.

487
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:40,060
Stay close to the ground. Build up your 
game, helping the little people.

488
00:37:40,130 --> 00:37:42,220
Like that lady that 
bought you the churro.

489
00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:46,900
Can't you just be like a friendly, 
neighborhood Spider-Man?

490
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,920
But I'm ready for 
more than that now.

491
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:51,010
No, you're not.

492
00:37:51,010 --> 00:37:53,400
That is not what you thought 
when I took on Captain America.

493
00:37:53,490 --> 00:37:56,500
Trust me, kid. If Cap wanted 
to lay you out, he would have.

494
00:37:56,500 --> 00:38:00,380
Listen to me. If you come across 
these weapons again, call Happy.

495
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:03,420
Are you driving?

496
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:05,940
You know, it's never too early 
to start thinking about college.

497
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:08,340
I got some pull at MIT. End call.

498
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:12,980
- No, I don't need to go to college, Mr. Stark...
- Mr. Stark is no longer connected.

499
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,800
That's awesome.

500
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:23,140
Stay close to the ground. 
What is he talking about?

501
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:47,610
- Hey, man, what's up? I'm on my way back.
- Actually, I was calling to say maybe you shouldn't come. Listen to this.

502
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:50,180
... When I say "Penis", 
you say "Parker"!

503
00:38:52,990 --> 00:38:56,260
Sorry, Peter. I guess we're still 
losers. I'll see you tomorrow.

504
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:58,300
I'll see you tomorrow in school.

505
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:40,300
Idiots.

506
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:43,825
Idiots. Idiots!

507
00:39:43,850 --> 00:39:45,876
Boss?

508
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:49,580
Your wife keeps texting you. 
Something about a brake light?

509
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:51,786
What'd I tell you about 
looking at my phone?

510
00:39:51,810 --> 00:39:55,620
Oh, sorry. You left it out. You 
know I'm a curious person by nature.

511
00:39:57,420 --> 00:40:00,410
I've finished designing that 
high altitude vacuum seal...

512
00:40:00,410 --> 00:40:04,140
In case you wanna, you 
know, go for the big one?

513
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:08,740
You're still on that? I told you, 
no. The answer's no. Forget it!

514
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:22,620
That was badass.

515
00:40:25,110 --> 00:40:29,000
How many times have I told you...
Not to fire them out in the open?

516
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,880
- You said move the merchandise!
- Under the radar. Under the radar!

517
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:35,330
That's how we survive.

518
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:38,970
If you bring Damage Control, or 
the Avengers down here, we're through.

519
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:42,210
And you're out there, wearing 
that goofy thing, lighting up cars...

520
00:40:42,270 --> 00:40:45,980
Calling yourself "The Shocker." 
I'm the Shocker. I shock people.

521
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:49,210
- What is this, pro wrestling?
- Yeah, whatever, old man. C'mon.

522
00:40:50,610 --> 00:40:52,780
Look, look.

523
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:57,620
I know, you don't give a 
crap about anything. But I do.

524
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:01,350
I built this whole place because 
I got people I have to look after.

525
00:41:01,370 --> 00:41:03,740
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

526
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:10,700
You know what? I can't 
afford your bullshit.

527
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:13,246
- Get outta here.
- What?!

528
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:16,620
- You're done, you're off the crew.
- Yeah. Alright.

529
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:20,820
I wonder if you can 
afford me out there...

530
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:25,130
- With everything I know.
- Excuse me?

531
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:27,176
I'm just saying...

532
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:30,240
Maybe your wife would like to know 
where you really get your money from.

533
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:32,900
- You know what?
- What?

534
00:41:32,970 --> 00:41:35,056
You're right.

535
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:37,080
- That work?
- I don't know.

536
00:41:37,210 --> 00:41:39,210
I can't afford that.

537
00:41:47,910 --> 00:41:49,910
Damn!

538
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:54,380
- I thought this was the anti-gravity gun.
- What?!

539
00:41:54,730 --> 00:41:57,730
No. That's that one.

540
00:42:09,150 --> 00:42:11,150
Here.

541
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:14,980
Now you're the Shocker. Go out there 
and find that weapon he lost.

542
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:17,540
Right.

543
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:29,600
- Hey, thanks for bailing on me.
- Yeah, well, something came up.

544
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:32,520
- What is that?
- I don't know.

545
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:35,400
- Some guy tried to vaporize me with it.
- Seriously?

546
00:42:35,425 --> 00:42:37,436
- Yeah.
- Awesome!

547
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:39,460
I mean, not awesome.

548
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:41,940
Totally uncool, that guy. So scary.

549
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:47,340
Well look. I think it's a power source.

550
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:50,070
Yeah, but it's connected 
to all those microprocessors.

551
00:42:50,070 --> 00:42:53,100
It's an inductive charging plate. 
That's what I use to charge my toothbrush.

552
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:56,410
Whoever's making these weapons is 
obviously combining the alien tech with ours.

553
00:42:56,620 --> 00:43:00,690
That is literally the coolest 
sentence anyone has ever said.

554
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:04,780
I just wanna thank you for letting me be 
a part of your journey, into this amazing...

555
00:43:08,950 --> 00:43:11,980
Keep your fingers 
clear of the blades.

556
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:16,370
I gotta figure out what 
this thing is and who makes it.

557
00:43:16,430 --> 00:43:18,740
We'll go to the lab after 
class and run some tests.

558
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:29,980
First, I say we put 
the glowy thing in the mass ().

559
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:32,420
First, we gotta come up with 
a better name than "glowy thingy".

560
00:43:32,620 --> 00:43:34,620
You're right.

561
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:38,860
Crap! Come on, come on, come on.

562
00:43:42,930 --> 00:43:44,930
High schools creep me out.

563
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:47,460
It's got this funny smell, 
you know what I mean?

564
00:43:47,590 --> 00:43:51,086
- That's one of the guys that tried to kill me.
- What?

565
00:43:51,110 --> 00:43:55,060
- We gotta get out of here.
- No, no, no. We got to follow them.

566
00:43:55,060 --> 00:43:57,400
Maybe they can lead me to the 
guy that dropped me in a lake.

567
00:43:57,580 --> 00:43:59,700
- Someone dropped you in a lake?
- Yeah. It was not good.

568
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:03,196
- Peter.
- No. Stay there, Ned.

569
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:05,220
Peter!

570
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:10,876
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

571
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:12,900
Yeah. You good?

572
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:15,220
Chess?

573
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:20,100
Can you imagine what the boss 
would say if he knew where we were?

574
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:23,120
I'm saying there was 
an energy pulse right here.

575
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:26,830
There's no sign of the weapon. I 
mean, even if it was here, now it's gone.

576
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:28,900
So are we...

577
00:45:00,190 --> 00:45:02,340
This is so awesome.

578
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:05,100
I know, right.

579
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:10,220
In Brooklyn.

580
00:45:14,250 --> 00:45:16,250
Staten Island.

581
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:23,700
Leaving Jersey.

582
00:45:31,180 --> 00:45:33,180
They stopped.

583
00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:37,980
- Maryland?
- What's there?

584
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:40,660
I don't know, evil lair?

585
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:44,220
- Evil lair?
- Dude, a gang with alien guns run by a guy with wings,

586
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:46,926
- yeah, they have a lair.
- Badass.

587
00:45:46,950 --> 00:45:49,700
But, how are you gonna get there 
if that's like, 300 miles away?

588
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:53,800
It's not too far from DC.

589
00:45:55,450 --> 00:45:57,660
- Hey, it's Peter!
- Guys!

590
00:45:57,660 --> 00:46:00,926
- Yeah, I was hoping maybe I could rejoin the team.
- No. No way.

591
00:46:00,950 --> 00:46:04,100
You can't just quit on us, stroll 
up, and be welcomed back by everyone.

592
00:46:04,180 --> 00:46:07,336
Hey, welcome back, Peter! Flash, 
you're back to first alternate.

593
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:09,366
- What?
- He's taking your place!

594
00:46:09,390 --> 00:46:11,396
Excuse me, can we go already?

595
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:14,520
'Cause I was hoping to get in some light protesting in 
front of one of the embassies before dinner, so...

596
00:46:14,550 --> 00:46:17,030
Protesting is patriotic. 
Let's get on the bus.

597
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:22,660
Focus up, everyone. Our next 
topic is the moons of Saturn.

598
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:26,316
- The second law of Thermodynamics.
- Frank Sinatra.

599
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:28,620
- Fort Sumpter.
- Flash is wrong.

600
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:31,000
- Okay guys, let's focus. Next one.
- Liz, don't overwork 'em.

601
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:35,860
- Strontium, Barium, Vibranium.
- Very good, Peter. Glad to have you back.

602
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:37,860
Glad to be back.

603
00:46:38,020 --> 00:46:40,076
What is the current state of unit...

604
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:42,420
- Can I take this real quick? I'll only be a second.
- Yeah, fine.

605
00:46:43,010 --> 00:46:46,100
- Hello?
- I got a blip on my screen here. You left New York?

606
00:46:46,620 --> 00:46:48,916
Tracker. Uh, yeah...

607
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:50,980
No, it's just a school trip, 
it's nothing. Look, Happy...

608
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:54,820
I gotta say, you tracking me without my 
permission is a complete violation of my privacy.

609
00:46:55,130 --> 00:46:57,196
- That's different.
- What's different?

610
00:46:57,220 --> 00:46:59,900
Nothing. Look, it's 
just the academic decathlon.

611
00:46:59,980 --> 00:47:02,850
- It's no big deal.
- Hey. I'll decide if it's no big deal.

612
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:07,950
Sounds like it's no big deal. 
But remember, I'm watching you.

613
00:47:19,180 --> 00:47:21,180
- Everyone stick together.
- Yeah.

614
00:47:22,180 --> 00:47:24,180
Are you kidding me? 
This place is huge!

615
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:26,860
- I've seen bigger.
- There's a bird in here.

616
00:47:27,020 --> 00:47:30,636
- Hey, you brought your laptop, right?
- Why?

617
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:41,880
Peter, why are we removing 
the tracker from your suit?

618
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:47,540
Because I gotta follow these guys 
to their boss before they move again...

619
00:47:47,710 --> 00:47:50,200
And I don't really want 
Mr. Stark to know about it.

620
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:54,466
- So you're lying to Iron Man now?
- No, I'm not lying.

621
00:47:54,490 --> 00:47:56,490
He just doesn't really 
get what I can do yet.

622
00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:03,456
Gotcha.

623
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:07,860
Alright, Happy. Enjoy tracking this lamp.

624
00:48:10,210 --> 00:48:12,860
There's a ton of 
other subsystems in here.

625
00:48:13,820 --> 00:48:17,510
But they're all disabled by the... 
"Training Wheels Protocol".

626
00:48:17,510 --> 00:48:20,780
What? The Training Wheels Protocol?

627
00:48:21,340 --> 00:48:23,980
- Turn it off.
- I don't think that's a good idea, I mean...

628
00:48:23,980 --> 00:48:26,036
They're probably 
blocked for a reason.

629
00:48:26,060 --> 00:48:28,120
Come on, man. I don't 
need training wheels.

630
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:30,580
I'm sick of him treating me 
like a kid all the time.

631
00:48:30,740 --> 00:48:33,286
- It's not cool.
- But you are a kid.

632
00:48:33,310 --> 00:48:35,540
Yeah. A kid who can stop 
a bus with his bare hands.

633
00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:39,596
Peter, I just don't think this is a great 
idea. I mean, what if this is illegal?

634
00:48:39,620 --> 00:48:42,460
Look, please. This is my 
chance to prove myself.

635
00:48:42,770 --> 00:48:46,436
- I can handle it. Ned, come on.
- I really don't think this is a good idea.

636
00:48:46,460 --> 00:48:48,978
- But, guy in the chair.
- Don't do that!

637
00:48:49,003 --> 00:48:51,064
Come on.

638
00:49:04,350 --> 00:49:06,420
Hey. The glowy thing is evidence. 
Keep it safe, all right?

639
00:49:06,540 --> 00:49:08,540
Okay.

640
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:11,380
- I'm moving.
- Be careful.

641
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,300
- Hey, Liz.
- Perfect timing. We're gonna go swimming.

642
00:49:18,340 --> 00:49:20,340
Come on! Come on.

643
00:49:20,660 --> 00:49:22,660
Hey, Peter.

644
00:49:26,740 --> 00:49:30,020
I was gonna go study, 
in the, business center.

645
00:49:30,140 --> 00:49:32,580
Peter, you don't need to study. 
You're like the smartest guy I've ever met.

646
00:49:32,620 --> 00:49:34,620
And besides...

647
00:49:34,650 --> 00:49:37,770
A rebellious group activity the day 
before competition is good for morale.

648
00:49:39,290 --> 00:49:41,360
Um, I read that in a TED talk, so...

649
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:43,360
I heard it in a TED talk.

650
00:49:44,010 --> 00:49:46,010
And I read a coaching book.

651
00:49:46,870 --> 00:49:48,870
Are you really, this 
is really important to you?

652
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:51,120
Yeah. It's our future.

653
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:53,280
I'm not gonna screw it up.

654
00:49:53,630 --> 00:49:57,580
And besides, we raided the minibar 
and these candy bars were like $11.

655
00:49:57,820 --> 00:50:00,260
So get your trunks 
on and come on.

656
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:04,140
- Come on. Come on.
- I'm coming!

657
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:30,420
- Good evening, Peter.
- Hello?

658
00:50:30,820 --> 00:50:33,820
Congratulations on completing 
your rigorous Training Wheels Protocol.

659
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:36,700
And gaining access to 
your suit's full capabilities.

660
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:40,060
- Ah, thank you.
- So where would you like to take me tonight?

661
00:50:40,060 --> 00:50:43,160
I put a tracker on 
someone. He's a bad guy.

662
00:50:43,230 --> 00:50:45,230
Tracker located.

663
00:50:45,620 --> 00:50:47,740
Plotting course to 
intercept target.

664
00:50:48,020 --> 00:50:51,100
Okay well, as long as I make it 
back in time for decathlon, it's fine.

665
00:50:59,050 --> 00:51:01,420
100 meters from 
destination and closing.

666
00:51:02,140 --> 00:51:04,140
Jump now.

667
00:51:08,150 --> 00:51:10,240
Detecting three individuals.

668
00:51:11,290 --> 00:51:14,660
Why is their secret lair in 
a gas station? That's so lame.

669
00:51:18,660 --> 00:51:22,120
- Hey, suit lady, what are they doing?
- Do you wanna hear what they're saying?

670
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:24,580
I can hear what they're 
saying? Uhh, yeah.

671
00:51:24,580 --> 00:51:26,580
Activating Enhanced 
Reconnaissance mode.

672
00:51:26,660 --> 00:51:29,220
I got the gauntlet from the Lagos 
cleanup. The rest is all mine.

673
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:31,356
Whoa. That's so cool.

674
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:33,620
Can't believe they're still 
cleaning up that Triskelion mess.

675
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:36,880
I love it. They keep making 
messes, we keep getting rich.

676
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:39,946
- Target inbound.
- Whoa, they're in the middle of a heist.

677
00:51:39,970 --> 00:51:42,340
I can catch them all 
red-handed. This is awesome!

678
00:51:42,420 --> 00:51:44,540
Okay, I'm gonna get a little closer 
so I can see what's happening.

679
00:51:44,730 --> 00:51:47,560
Would you like me to 
engage Enhanced Combat mode?

680
00:51:47,660 --> 00:51:50,060
"Enhanced Combat mode"? Yeah.

681
00:51:50,180 --> 00:51:53,970
- Activating Instant Kill.
- No, no, no, no. I don't wanna kill anybody.

682
00:51:54,070 --> 00:51:56,070
Deactivating Instant Kill.

683
00:51:59,170 --> 00:52:01,170
Did you hear that?

684
00:52:01,380 --> 00:52:03,500
What the hell just happened?
What was that?

685
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:06,249
You jumped off the sign 
and landed on your face.

686
00:52:06,274 --> 00:52:09,816
Suit lady, what's wrong 
with my web shooters?

687
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:12,420
Rapid-fire is the default 
for Enhanced Combat mode.

688
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:15,406
- Why would I need Rapid-fire?
- Would you like to see more options?

689
00:52:15,430 --> 00:52:18,540
You have 576 possible 
web shooter combinations.

690
00:52:18,890 --> 00:52:21,820
- Mr. Stark really overdid it.
- You two wait right here.

691
00:52:21,820 --> 00:52:25,540
Wait, you're gonna wanna turn on the dampers 
or that thing will shatter your arm.

692
00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:28,036
- Where's the dampers?
- That one!

693
00:52:28,061 --> 00:52:31,540
Great choice! Would you like me 
to set this as your new default?

694
00:52:33,070 --> 00:52:35,313
- No, no, no!
- Push that in...

695
00:52:35,338 --> 00:52:37,356
- Right here?
- No, no. Yeah, push it.

696
00:52:37,380 --> 00:52:39,620
- What was that?
- Taser webs.

697
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:41,796
Taser webs? I don't 
want taser webs.

698
00:52:41,820 --> 00:52:44,580
You seem to be very unfamiliar 
with your web shooter settings.

699
00:52:44,860 --> 00:52:48,080
- Would you like to run a refresher course?
- No, just, you choose.

700
00:52:48,140 --> 00:52:51,740
- Sure thing.
- 6-Alpha-Niner, are you running on time?

701
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:55,740
Copy, Central. 6-Alpha-Niner, on schedule.

702
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:00,500
- I have a visual.
- Green light. Green light.

703
00:53:04,620 --> 00:53:06,620
That's him.

704
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:11,980
Okay. I got eyes on the convoy.

705
00:53:12,140 --> 00:53:14,140
Pulling in behing the (cabooze).

706
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:17,420
Deploy anchors.

707
00:53:26,860 --> 00:53:28,860
Dropping down.

708
00:53:30,710 --> 00:53:33,140
No outgoing distress signals. 
You're all clear.

709
00:53:35,780 --> 00:53:37,780
Looks like they got 
some good stuff here.

710
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:49,460
Cool. It's like some kind 
of matter phase shifter.

711
00:53:54,020 --> 00:53:56,020
All right. Coming up.

712
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:03,780
Hey, big bird! This 
doesn't belong to you!

713
00:54:04,740 --> 00:54:06,740
Oh, God.

714
00:54:12,740 --> 00:54:14,900
- Suit lady, what was that?
- You told me to choose.

715
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:19,180
What, no. Just set 
everything back to normal!

716
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:21,540
Activating all systems.

717
00:54:37,970 --> 00:54:41,540
- Oh. My head.
- You appear to have a mild concussion.

718
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:49,476
- So, where am I right now?
- I'm not sure.

719
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:51,860
The container walls are 
hindering my sensors.

720
00:54:53,020 --> 00:54:55,036
Wait a minute.

721
00:54:55,060 --> 00:54:57,780
They must've hijacked the truck 
and taken me to their evil lair.

722
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:01,900
Okay. So maybe we're gonna have 
to fight our way out of this one.

723
00:55:02,620 --> 00:55:04,620
Three, two, one!

724
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:14,690
What is this place? 
Suit lady, where am I?

725
00:55:14,690 --> 00:55:17,540
You're in the most secure 
facility on the eastern seaboard.

726
00:55:17,570 --> 00:55:19,596
The Damage Control 
deep storage vault.

727
00:55:19,620 --> 00:55:21,620
No! Seriously?

728
00:55:24,740 --> 00:55:26,880
The door will most likely 
remain closed until morning.

729
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:29,036
Morning?

730
00:55:29,060 --> 00:55:33,700
Hey, suit lady. I kinda feel bad 
calling you "Suit Lady", you know?

731
00:55:34,460 --> 00:55:37,756
I think I should 
probably give you a name.

732
00:55:37,780 --> 00:55:41,100
Like Liz. No, no, 
no. God, that's weird.

733
00:55:41,180 --> 00:55:46,226
- What about KAREN?
- You can call me KAREN if you'd like.

734
00:55:46,250 --> 00:55:48,580
Hey, KAREN. What else 
can this suit do?

735
00:55:50,260 --> 00:55:53,160
What? Maybe we should 
run that refresher course.

736
00:55:53,380 --> 00:55:55,380
- Ricochet web.
- Ricochet web.

737
00:55:55,940 --> 00:55:59,030
- Cool.
- Stutter web.

738
00:55:59,740 --> 00:56:02,780
- Web grenade.
- Web grenade!

739
00:56:04,660 --> 00:56:06,900
Should I tell Liz 
that I'm Spider-Man?

740
00:56:07,020 --> 00:56:10,860
- Who's Liz?
- Who's Liz?

741
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:15,340
She's the best. She's awesome. She's 
just a girl who goes to my school.

742
00:56:17,060 --> 00:56:21,220
And, yeah. I really wanna tell her, 
but it's kinda weird. You know?

743
00:56:21,250 --> 00:56:26,036
- "Hey. I'm Spider-Man."
- What's weird about that?

744
00:56:26,060 --> 00:56:30,220
What if she's expecting someone like Tony Stark? 
Imagine how disappointed she'd be when she sees me.

745
00:56:30,340 --> 00:56:34,076
Well, if I were her, I wouldn't 
be disappointed at all.

746
00:56:34,100 --> 00:56:37,740
Thanks, KAREN. It's really nice 
to have somebody to talk to.

747
00:56:38,580 --> 00:56:41,346
- Hey, how long have we been here, anyway?
- 37 minutes.

748
00:56:41,371 --> 00:56:44,516
What? 37 minutes? That's insane!

749
00:56:44,540 --> 00:56:48,490
I cannot take this anymore. 
I gotta get out of here.

750
00:56:50,060 --> 00:56:52,500
There's gotta be something 
in here I can use.

751
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:55,500
Okay, let's see.

752
00:56:55,860 --> 00:56:57,860
Nope.

753
00:56:58,460 --> 00:57:02,940
That's awesome. Hey, it's 
like the glowy thing.

754
00:57:02,940 --> 00:57:05,560
That glowy thing is an 
explosive Chitauri energy core.

755
00:57:06,460 --> 00:57:11,740
- Whoa, you mean we've been carrying around a bomb?
- It would require radiation to transform it into an explosive state.

756
00:57:12,110 --> 00:57:14,110
No, no, no, no!

757
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:21,820
Hey, please! Please! 
Somebody let me out! Hey!

758
00:57:21,940 --> 00:57:24,020
KAREN you have to help me 
override that timelock!

759
00:57:25,180 --> 00:57:28,456
- Okay, KAREN, lower the voltage and run it.
- Trial unsuccessful.

760
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:30,480
Okay, we're just gonna 
have to try every sequence.

761
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:36,100
Ned, Peter, we're gonna 
be late. Come on. Let's go.

762
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:38,900
Okay. Hold on, hold on.

763
00:57:42,870 --> 00:57:45,500
Initiating trial 247.

764
00:57:46,460 --> 00:57:48,460
It worked! It works!

765
00:58:00,550 --> 00:58:04,380
Please be sure all 
cellphones are turned off.

766
00:58:05,220 --> 00:58:07,614
KAREN, you have to get me to the 
decathlon as fast as possible!

767
00:58:07,639 --> 00:58:10,686
- Sure thing. Just tell me where it is.
- It's right across the street from the Washington Monument.

768
00:58:10,710 --> 00:58:13,780
- Hey, it's Ned. Leave a message.
- Ned, call me back! The glowy thing's a bomb!

769
00:58:18,860 --> 00:58:20,860
There's a vehicle 
approaching on your right.

770
00:58:21,460 --> 00:58:23,660
We have now entered 
sudden death.

771
00:58:23,780 --> 00:58:27,020
The next correct answer 
wins the championship.

772
00:58:31,140 --> 00:58:35,196
- Midtown Tech?
- Zero.

773
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:38,740
That is correct. Midtown 
takes the championship!

774
00:58:40,420 --> 00:58:42,420
- We won!
- Guys, I'm so proud of you!

775
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:45,220
Flash, you didn't answer 
a single question.

776
00:58:45,310 --> 00:58:47,396
Taking it all in, Michelle?

777
00:58:47,420 --> 00:58:51,780
Oh, yeah, I just umm, I don't really wanna 
celebrate something that was built by slaves.

778
00:58:51,820 --> 00:58:54,370
Oh, I'm sure the Washington 
Monument wasn't built by...

779
00:58:57,560 --> 00:59:00,540
Okay. Enjoy your book.

780
00:59:00,565 --> 00:59:02,604
Thanks.

781
00:59:03,860 --> 00:59:06,300
- Oh, Ned. You're alive!
- Peter, are you okay?

782
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:09,500
- Ned, Ned, where's the glowy thing?
- Don't worry. It's safe. It's in my backpack.

783
00:59:09,540 --> 00:59:11,591
No, Ned! Listen! No, Ned! 
The glowy thing is dangerous!

784
00:59:11,616 --> 00:59:13,797
You missed the decathlon. 
I covered for you...

785
00:59:13,822 --> 00:59:15,876
- Ned, listen to me!
- We're in the Washington Monument. How're you gonna...

786
00:59:15,901 --> 00:59:17,957
- Peter, is that you?
- Oh, hey, Liz!

787
00:59:17,982 --> 00:59:20,041
- Is that Liz?
- Please put Ned back on the phone.

788
00:59:20,066 --> 00:59:22,766
- You should tell her how you feel.
- Seriously, you are so lucky we won!

789
00:59:22,790 --> 00:59:25,836
You know, I wanna be mad, but I'm real 
worried. Like, what is going on with you?

790
00:59:25,860 --> 00:59:28,836
- Liz, I have to talk to Ned, it's really important!
- Miss, all items on the belt, please.

791
00:59:28,860 --> 00:59:31,380
Liz, there's something in his backpack 
that is really dangerous. Don't let it go through an x-ray.

792
00:59:34,860 --> 00:59:36,860
Liz? Liz? Dammit!

793
00:59:40,470 --> 00:59:43,560
Hey Mr. Harrington, can I be the 
one to tell Peter he's expelled?

794
00:59:47,190 --> 00:59:53,300
The Washington Monument is 555 
feet, 5 and one eighth inches tall.

795
00:59:56,150 --> 00:59:59,000
(), () , marble and granite 
are cut around the stone.

796
01:00:05,420 --> 01:00:07,420
No, no, no, no! KAREN, 
what's going on up there?

797
01:00:08,380 --> 01:00:12,060
The Chitauri core has detonated and 
caused severe structural damage to the elevator.

798
01:00:12,540 --> 01:00:14,576
- My friends are up there.
- What?!

799
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:16,676
Uh, don't worry, ma'am. 
Everything's gonna be okay.

800
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:19,220
Excuse me, excuse me! 
Oh my God, that's tall!

801
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:28,352
- Oh, my God. Look at the ceiling.
- Just stay calm everyone.

802
01:00:28,377 --> 01:00:30,460
We are going to die here.

803
01:00:31,385 --> 01:00:34,544
Estimating 10 minutes 
before catastrophic failure.

804
01:00:35,060 --> 01:00:37,495
- We're freaking screwed.
- Okay, guys, I know that looks scary,

805
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:39,980
but our safety systems are working.

806
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,280
The safety systems 
are completely failing.

807
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:46,600
- We're very safe in here.
- The occupants are in imminent mortal danger.

808
01:00:46,760 --> 01:00:48,760
I'm going as fast as I can!

809
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:03,520
You now have 125 seconds 
until catastrophic failure.

810
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:07,430
- What? Why?
- Unexpected motion has caused the deterioration to escalate.

811
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:11,040
- How do I get in there?
- Activating Reconnaissance Drone.

812
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:16,200
Whoa. Has that been there this 
whole time? That's awesome!

813
01:01:16,320 --> 01:01:18,760
Locating optimal entry point.

814
01:01:20,360 --> 01:01:23,160
- Proceed to southwest window.
- KAREN I'm on my way.

815
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:49,200
Oh, God. Oh, God. Okay.

816
01:01:51,270 --> 01:01:53,800
What's wrong? You've reached 
the southwest window.

817
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:57,320
- Why are you hesitating?
- It's just I've never been this high before.

818
01:01:57,360 --> 01:01:59,720
You have also not 
reinstalled your parachute,

819
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:02,360
so a fall from this height 
would most likely be lethal.

820
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:06,120
Alright.

821
01:02:08,990 --> 01:02:11,320
- Why is it not breaking?
- It's 4 inch ballistic glass.

822
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:13,360
You'll have to create 
more momentum.

823
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:35,100
This is DC metro police. 
Identify yourself.

824
01:02:35,180 --> 01:02:37,256
My friends are in there! Stop!

825
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:39,280
Return to the ground! 
Immediately!

826
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:41,376
- Okay, who's next?
- Me! It's my turn!

827
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:43,400
Flash, seriously? 
What are you doing?

828
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:46,320
Don't worry 
about the trophy!

829
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:57,360
Stand down! Return to 
the ground immediately!

830
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:04,120
Return to the ground, 
or we will open fire!

831
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:08,296
- Go up, go up!
- I got this.

832
01:03:08,320 --> 01:03:10,320
Take my trophy.

833
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
This is your last chance.

834
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:16,240
I'm gonna die.

835
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:42,120
I did it!

836
01:03:55,240 --> 01:03:57,960
Hey, how you doing? Don't 
worry about it, I got you.

837
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,096
Yes! Yes!

838
01:04:00,120 --> 01:04:03,600
- Hey, hey, hey! Big guy, quit moving around!
- I'm sorry, sir! So sorry.

839
01:04:14,360 --> 01:04:16,360
- You can go.
- Okay.

840
01:04:16,460 --> 01:04:19,400
All right. This is your 
stop. Go, go, go.

841
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:22,080
Everybody out. Move 
it people. Move it.

842
01:04:24,040 --> 01:04:26,040
Liz!

843
01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:31,600
You're okay. You're okay.

844
01:04:34,450 --> 01:04:38,640
- Okay.
- Good. Come on up, come on.

845
01:04:38,860 --> 01:04:41,560
- Guys, stand back.
- I got you.

846
01:04:42,270 --> 01:04:44,270
So, is everyone okay?

847
01:04:44,840 --> 01:04:46,840
This is your chance, Peter.

848
01:04:47,160 --> 01:04:49,160
Kiss her.

849
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:54,680
Thank you.

850
01:04:57,460 --> 01:04:59,800
Are you really friends 
with Peter Parker?

851
01:05:06,750 --> 01:05:08,750
I can finish the next order,

852
01:05:08,830 --> 01:05:11,040
but without any new 
materials from that truck...

853
01:05:12,930 --> 01:05:14,930
Dammit...

854
01:05:15,230 --> 01:05:17,350
We're still enough to do the 
Gargan deal though, right?

855
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:19,440
Yeah. But then, that's it.

856
01:05:23,100 --> 01:05:25,840
Maybe it's time that I 
build the high altitude seal.

857
01:05:25,910 --> 01:05:28,280
- Would you shut up about that?
- Look, one job...

858
01:05:28,322 --> 01:05:30,356
No.

859
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:33,120
Eight years. Not a 
word from the feds.

860
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:37,440
Nothing from those halloween costume-
wearing bozos up there in Stark Tower.

861
01:05:38,100 --> 01:05:42,680
And then all of a sudden, this little 
bastard in red tights shows up...

862
01:05:43,310 --> 01:05:45,960
And he thinks he can tear 
down everything I built.

863
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:50,200
Really?

864
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:54,616
- I'm gonna kill him. I'm gonna find him...
- Found him.

865
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:59,480
The Spider-Man swooped in, heroically 
saving an academic decathlon team from Queens.

866
01:05:59,560 --> 01:06:02,640
The identity of the masked 
hero is still unknown.

867
01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:06,680
Mom!

868
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:09,360
Peter. Come here!

869
01:06:13,640 --> 01:06:17,944
This past weekend, Midtown's academic 
decathlon team defeated the country's best

870
01:06:18,070 --> 01:06:21,280
to win the national championship. Later 
that day, they also defeated death.

871
01:06:21,320 --> 01:06:24,120
Explosives! Sally screamed! Flash screamed, everybody screaming!

872
01:06:24,200 --> 01:06:27,800
There were purple lasers and smoke everywhere. 
It was (beep) tight. Just like a Bon Jovi concert.

873
01:06:27,910 --> 01:06:30,840
As you know, we made it out alive. 
And that's the important thing.

874
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:34,020
I couldn't bear to lose a 
student on a school trip.

875
01:06:35,880 --> 01:06:39,520
- Not again.
- Thankfully, no one was seriously injured.

876
01:06:39,560 --> 01:06:43,456
- Thanks to the Spider-Man.
- Thank you, Spider-Man.

877
01:06:43,480 --> 01:06:46,520
Up next: The Spider-Man 
mania is sweeping the school.

878
01:06:46,560 --> 01:06:48,840
How can you show 
your Spider spirit?

879
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:54,160
Dude, dude, dude...

880
01:06:54,180 --> 01:06:57,420
What is it like being famous 
when nobody knows it's you?

881
01:06:57,440 --> 01:06:59,520
- Crazy, Ned.
- It is crazy!

882
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:01,520
- Should we tell everyone?
- No.

883
01:07:01,840 --> 01:07:04,760
- Should I tell everyone?
- No, dude. That's not a good idea.

884
01:07:05,560 --> 01:07:07,560
- Okay. Well, we're gonna go to class.
- I'm not going to class.

885
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:11,520
- But you're already in so much trouble for ditching the decathlon...
- Dude, listen, I figured it out, right...

886
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:13,840
The wing suit guy is stealing 
from Damage Control.

887
01:07:13,840 --> 01:07:18,400
And what he takes from Damage Control, that's 
how he builds the weapons. All I gotta do is catch him!

888
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:22,080
- But we have a Spanish quiz.
- Ned, I'm probably never gonna come back here.

889
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:24,840
Mr. Stark is moving the 
Avengers upstate, so...

890
01:07:25,540 --> 01:07:27,840
- when I bring this guy in...
- Dude!

891
01:07:28,010 --> 01:07:30,010
You wanna be a 
high school dropout?

892
01:07:30,040 --> 01:07:32,440
I am so far beyond 
high school right now.

893
01:07:32,760 --> 01:07:35,000
Parker! My office.

894
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:42,480
So. You got detention. 
You screwed up.

895
01:07:42,630 --> 01:07:46,010
You know what you did was wrong. The 
question is, how are you gonna make things right?

896
01:07:46,140 --> 01:07:48,176
Maybe you were 
trying to be cool.

897
01:07:48,200 --> 01:07:51,040
But take it from a guy who's 
been frozen for 65 years.

898
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:54,640
The only way to really be 
cool, is to follow the rules.

899
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:57,600
We all know what's right. 
We all know what's wrong.

900
01:07:57,760 --> 01:08:00,840
Next time those turkeys try to convince you that something you know...

901
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:03,040
Hey, where are you 
going? Get back here!

902
01:08:03,380 --> 01:08:05,380
What would Captain America do?

903
01:08:05,560 --> 01:08:07,600
Why are you here? You 
don't even have detention.

904
01:08:07,600 --> 01:08:11,600
Oh, I know. I just like coming 
here to sketch people in crisis.

905
01:08:13,600 --> 01:08:16,136
It's you.

906
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:19,880
So your body's changing. Believe 
me, I know how that feels.

907
01:08:31,840 --> 01:08:33,840
May?

908
01:08:37,070 --> 01:08:40,040
- Hey, KAREN, what's up?
- Hey, Peter. How was your Spanish quiz?

909
01:08:40,120 --> 01:08:43,760
Listen, I was wondering if you could help me. I'm trying to figure out who the guys...

910
01:08:43,860 --> 01:08:46,480
under the bridge were that night, but, I 
mean I can only kinda remember part of the license plate.

911
01:08:46,610 --> 01:08:49,160
I can run facial recognition on 
the footage of that encounter.

912
01:08:49,160 --> 01:08:51,256
- Footage?
- Yes, Peter.

913
01:08:51,280 --> 01:08:53,658
- I record everything you see.
- Everything?

914
01:08:53,683 --> 01:08:55,782
- Everything.
- Like, all the time?

915
01:08:55,807 --> 01:08:59,680
- It's called the Baby Monitor Protocol.
- Yeah, of course, it is.

916
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:03,940
- Yeah, just roll it back to last Friday.
- With pleasure.

917
01:09:03,980 --> 01:09:06,000
Hey, everyone! Yeah, kick-
ass party. Hey, what's up, Liz?

918
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,360
Peter told me 
a lot about you.

919
01:09:08,500 --> 01:09:12,720
No, this is just me messing 
around. Go later in the day.

920
01:09:12,720 --> 01:09:18,170
- It is I, Thor, son of Odin!
- No, no, no. That's definitely not what we wanna watch.

921
01:09:18,360 --> 01:09:21,976
- Your impressions are very funny.
- Fast forward to the arms deal.

922
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,976
Okay. The two on the 
right, who are they?

923
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,320
Searching law 
enforcement databases...

924
01:09:27,580 --> 01:09:30,800
- No records found for two of the individuals.
- Nothing?

925
01:09:30,840 --> 01:09:34,200
One individual identified. 
Aaron Davis, age 33.

926
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:38,956
- He has a criminal record. And an address here in Queens.
- Let's pay him a visit.

927
01:09:38,980 --> 01:09:42,080
Would you like me to activate the 
Enhanced Interrogation Protocol?

928
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:44,960
Yeah.

929
01:09:58,110 --> 01:10:00,110
Remember me?

930
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:02,600
I need information and you're 
gonna give it to me now!

931
01:10:02,700 --> 01:10:04,700
- Alright, chill...
- Come on!

932
01:10:05,230 --> 01:10:07,600
- What happened to your voice?
- What do you mean, what happened to my voice?

933
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:09,850
I heard you by the bridge. 
I know what a girl sound like.

934
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:13,376
I'm not a girl! I'm a boy! 
I mean, I'm a man.

935
01:10:13,400 --> 01:10:17,096
- I don't care what you are. Boy, girl...
- I'm not a girl! I'm a man.

936
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:19,560
Come on, man. Look, who 
is selling these weapons?

937
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:21,920
I need to know. Give 
me names, or else.

938
01:10:25,260 --> 01:10:27,286
You ain't ever done 
this before, huh?

939
01:10:27,310 --> 01:10:29,600
Deactivate interrogation mode.

940
01:10:31,390 --> 01:10:35,140
Look man, these guys are selling 
weapons that are crazy dangerous.

941
01:10:35,180 --> 01:10:37,276
They can't just be 
out on the streets.

942
01:10:37,300 --> 01:10:39,780
Look, if one of them can just 
cut Delmar's bodega in half...

943
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:42,240
- You know Delmar's?
- Yeah. The best sandwich in Queens.

944
01:10:42,520 --> 01:10:44,750
- The subhaven's pretty good.
- Nah, it's too much bread.

945
01:10:44,750 --> 01:10:47,680
- I like bread.
- Come on, man. Please.

946
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:52,226
Stupid interrogation mode. 
KAREN, don't ever do that again.

947
01:10:52,250 --> 01:10:55,260
The other night, you told that dude 
"if you're gonna shoot somebody, shoot me."

948
01:10:55,340 --> 01:10:57,386
That's pretty ballsy.

949
01:10:57,410 --> 01:11:00,680
I don't want those weapons in this neighborhood. 
I got a nephew who live here.

950
01:11:02,150 --> 01:11:04,660
Who are these guys? What can you 
tell me about the guy with the wings?

951
01:11:04,680 --> 01:11:07,760
Other than he's a psychopath 
dressed like a demon? Nothing.

952
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:10,400
I don't know who he is, 
or where he is.

953
01:11:12,920 --> 01:11:14,920
I do know where 
he's gonna be.

954
01:11:15,630 --> 01:11:19,800
- Really?
- Yeah, this crazy dude I used to work with. He's...

955
01:11:20,200 --> 01:11:23,306
- He's supposed to be doing a deal with him.
- Yes! Yeah!

956
01:11:25,120 --> 01:11:27,320
Hey. I didn't tell you where. 
You don't have a location.

957
01:11:27,640 --> 01:11:30,160
Right. Of course. Yeah. 
My bad. Silly. Just... Yeah.

958
01:11:30,440 --> 01:11:32,736
Where is it?

959
01:11:32,760 --> 01:11:37,120
Can I give you some advice? You 
gotta get better at this part of the job.

960
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:40,296
I don't understand. 
I'm intimidating.

961
01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:43,360
- The Staten Island Ferry. 11:00.
- Oh, that's soon.

962
01:11:43,640 --> 01:11:45,640
Hey that's gonna 
dissolve in two hours.

963
01:11:45,680 --> 01:11:48,000
No, no, no, no.
Come fix this.

964
01:11:48,100 --> 01:11:50,106
- Two hours. You deserve that.
- I got ice cream here, man.

965
01:11:50,131 --> 01:11:52,656
You deserve that, you're 
a criminal. Bye, Mr. Criminal!

966
01:12:07,240 --> 01:12:09,240
Nice.

967
01:12:11,770 --> 01:12:14,640
Okay, KAREN. Activate Enhanced 
Reconnaissance mode.

968
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:18,200
- Sure thing.
- He's out front. Main deck.

969
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:21,536
- I hate this guy.
- That's the guy from the bridge, right?

970
01:12:21,560 --> 01:12:23,696
- Who's that other guy?
- Just keep me posted.

971
01:12:23,720 --> 01:12:25,920
There's no record of him 
in my criminal database.

972
01:12:26,150 --> 01:12:28,960
Incoming call from May Parker. Shall 
I reroute to your heads-up display?

973
01:12:29,200 --> 01:12:31,200
I can't talk right now. 
I'll call her back.

974
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:34,690
Hey, Droney. Keep 
an eye on that guy.

975
01:12:34,720 --> 01:12:36,720
We can't let anybody 
get away this time.

976
01:12:44,970 --> 01:12:46,970
- Who's the guy on the left?
- Mac Gargan.

977
01:12:47,320 --> 01:12:49,600
Extensive criminal 
record including homicide.

978
01:12:49,820 --> 01:12:51,896
Would you like me 
to activate Instant Kill?

979
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:54,440
No, KAREN. Stop it with 
the Instant Kill already!

980
01:12:56,420 --> 01:12:58,420
White pick-up truck.

981
01:13:02,790 --> 01:13:05,520
Droney, scan the ship 
for a white pick-up truck.

982
01:13:26,330 --> 01:13:29,600
This is too perfect. They got the 
weapons, the buyers, and the sellers all in one place.

983
01:13:29,880 --> 01:13:32,000
Incoming call from Tony Stark.

984
01:13:32,220 --> 01:13:34,240
- No, no, no. Don't answer!
- Mr. Parker.

985
01:13:34,680 --> 01:13:37,160
- Got a sec?
- Uhh, I'm actually at school.

986
01:13:37,200 --> 01:13:40,120
- No, you're not.
- Nice work in DC...

987
01:13:40,440 --> 01:13:45,296
My Dad never really gave me a lot of 
support. Now I'm just trying to break the cycle of chain...

988
01:13:45,320 --> 01:13:48,200
- I'm kind of in the middle of something right now...
- Don't cut me off when I'm complimenting you.

989
01:13:49,400 --> 01:13:51,560
Anyway. Great things are about 
to happen... What is that?

990
01:13:52,200 --> 01:13:54,200
I'm at band practice?

991
01:13:54,630 --> 01:13:58,160
That's odd. Happy told me 
you quit band six weeks ago.

992
01:13:58,160 --> 01:14:00,480
- What's up?
- I got to go. End call!

993
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:03,280
I'll take those!

994
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,680
Hey guys. The illegal weapons 
deal ferry was at 10:30.

995
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:10,800
You missed it.

996
01:14:18,440 --> 01:14:20,440
Spider-guy's here.

997
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:24,880
Whoa, whoa, 
whoa, not so fast.

998
01:14:26,250 --> 01:14:28,560
Are you guys okay? My 
bad. That was a little hard.

999
01:14:30,040 --> 01:14:32,240
I gotta say, the other guy was 
way better with that thing.

1000
01:14:33,680 --> 01:14:36,080
And honestly, 
I'm--- I'm shocked.

1001
01:14:48,920 --> 01:14:52,160
Freeze! FBI! Get 
on the ground!

1002
01:14:52,820 --> 01:14:55,640
- Wait, what do you mean, FBI?
- The FBI is the Federal Bureau of Investigation...

1003
01:14:55,640 --> 01:14:57,880
I know what the FBI means, 
but what are they doing here?

1004
01:15:05,720 --> 01:15:08,760
Get outta the way! 
Get outta the way!

1005
01:15:11,960 --> 01:15:14,080
Look out, look out! 
Move, move, move!

1006
01:15:20,280 --> 01:15:22,880
Get to the top deck. 
We're getting out of here.

1007
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:04,640
Activate taser web!

1008
01:16:15,630 --> 01:16:18,160
You're messing with things 
you don't understand.

1009
01:16:57,580 --> 01:16:59,640
Oh, my God! 
What do I do?

1010
01:16:59,650 --> 01:17:02,950
KAREN, give me an x-ray of the 
boat and target all the strongest points.

1011
01:17:06,310 --> 01:17:08,310
Web grenade. 
Web grenade!

1012
01:17:10,440 --> 01:17:12,440
Stutter web.

1013
01:17:40,090 --> 01:17:44,696
- Great job, Peter. You're 98% successful.
- 98?

1014
01:17:44,720 --> 01:17:46,720
Yeah, Spider-Man!

1015
01:17:49,120 --> 01:17:51,120
No, no!

1016
01:18:08,320 --> 01:18:10,320
No!

1017
01:18:25,360 --> 01:18:27,360
What the hell?

1018
01:18:30,480 --> 01:18:32,480
What the hell?

1019
01:18:34,120 --> 01:18:37,980
Hi, Spider-Man! 
"Band practice", was it?

1020
01:18:59,920 --> 01:19:01,920
Yeah, Iron Man!

1021
01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:14,480
Uhh, Mr. Stark? Hey, 
Mr. Stark, can I do anything?

1022
01:19:14,480 --> 01:19:16,480
What do you 
want me to do?

1023
01:19:17,170 --> 01:19:19,240
I think you've 
done enough.

1024
01:19:33,510 --> 01:19:36,280
So that's it? You're 
just gonna run?

1025
01:19:39,060 --> 01:19:41,060
Feds were waiting for us.

1026
01:19:41,770 --> 01:19:43,800
And now, we're on 
Iron Man's radar?

1027
01:19:44,840 --> 01:19:46,840
Yeah, I'm running.

1028
01:19:47,610 --> 01:19:51,176
- You should, too.
- You know I can't do that.

1029
01:19:51,200 --> 01:19:54,336
- So now, what?
- Mason.

1030
01:19:54,360 --> 01:19:57,840
Can you get that high altitude 
seal up and running in time?

1031
01:19:58,520 --> 01:20:01,216
Seriously? Yes.

1032
01:20:01,240 --> 01:20:03,240
You will not regret this.

1033
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:07,760
You in?

1034
01:20:17,840 --> 01:20:21,760
Previously on "Peter screws the Pooch," 
I thought you'd stayed away from this,

1035
01:20:22,010 --> 01:20:26,760
instead, you hacked a multi-million 
dollar suit so you could sneak around,

1036
01:20:26,770 --> 01:20:30,040
behind my back, doing the 
one thing I told you not to do.

1037
01:20:30,340 --> 01:20:33,970
- Is everyone okay?
- No thanks to you.

1038
01:20:35,220 --> 01:20:37,220
No thanks to me?

1039
01:20:39,050 --> 01:20:42,800
Those weapons were out there and I 
tried to tell you about it, but you didn't listen.

1040
01:20:43,080 --> 01:20:45,920
None of this would've happened 
if you had just listened to me.

1041
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:48,840
If you even cared, 
you'd actually be here.

1042
01:20:53,320 --> 01:20:56,280
I did listen, kid. Who do 
you think called the FBI, huh?

1043
01:20:56,930 --> 01:20:59,440
Do you know that I was the 
only one who believed in you?

1044
01:20:59,540 --> 01:21:03,440
Everyone else said I was crazy 
to recruit a 14-year old kid.

1045
01:21:03,480 --> 01:21:06,600
- I'm 15.
- No, this is where you zip it! All right? The adult is talking.

1046
01:21:06,940 --> 01:21:10,920
What if somebody had died tonight? 
Different story, right? 'Cause that's on you.

1047
01:21:11,480 --> 01:21:15,000
And if you died... I 
feel like that's on me.

1048
01:21:15,830 --> 01:21:18,705
- I don't need that on my conscience.
- Yes, sir... I'm sorry, I...

1049
01:21:18,730 --> 01:21:23,336
- Sorry doesn't cut it.
- I understand. I just wanted to be like you.

1050
01:21:23,360 --> 01:21:25,360
And I wanted 
you to be better.

1051
01:21:26,620 --> 01:21:28,620
Okay. It's not working out. 
I'm gonna need the suit back.

1052
01:21:28,620 --> 01:21:30,716
- For how long?
- Forever.

1053
01:21:30,740 --> 01:21:32,740
No. No, no, no. Please...

1054
01:21:32,820 --> 01:21:34,856
- Let's have it.
- You don't understand...

1055
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:37,100
This is all I have. I'm 
nothing without this suit.

1056
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:41,600
If you're nothing without this 
suit, then you shouldn't have it.

1057
01:21:41,690 --> 01:21:44,290
Okay? God, I 
sound like my dad.

1058
01:21:45,880 --> 01:21:47,880
I don't have 
any other clothes.

1059
01:21:48,480 --> 01:21:50,480
Okay. We'll sort that out.

1060
01:22:06,850 --> 01:22:09,840
I've been calling you all day.

1061
01:22:10,120 --> 01:22:13,880
But you don't answer your phone. You 
can't do that. Then this ferry thing happens...

1062
01:22:14,480 --> 01:22:17,520
I've called five 
police stations.

1063
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:20,800
Five. I called 5 of your 
friends. I called Ned's mother.

1064
01:22:20,920 --> 01:22:23,840
I'm fine. May, I'm okay. 
Honestly, just relax. I'm fine.

1065
01:22:25,250 --> 01:22:28,420
Cut the bullshit. I 
know you left detention.

1066
01:22:28,420 --> 01:22:30,720
I know you left the hotel 
room in Washington.

1067
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:34,550
I know you sneak out of this 
house every night. There's no fine.

1068
01:22:34,550 --> 01:22:36,760
Peter, you have to tell 
me what's going on.

1069
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:39,280
Just lay it out. It's 
just me and you.

1070
01:22:41,080 --> 01:22:43,080
I lost the Stark internship.

1071
01:22:43,100 --> 01:22:45,196
- What?
- Yeah.

1072
01:22:45,220 --> 01:22:47,296
What happened?

1073
01:22:47,320 --> 01:22:50,880
I just said that I could work really hard, 
and he could, he would, you know...

1074
01:22:51,240 --> 01:22:54,600
But... I screwed it up.

1075
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:56,800
That's okay. It's okay.

1076
01:22:58,280 --> 01:23:00,280
It's okay.

1077
01:23:00,840 --> 01:23:02,840
I'm sorry I made you worry.

1078
01:23:03,280 --> 01:23:06,400
- You know I'm not trying to ruin your life.
- Yeah, I know.

1079
01:23:08,240 --> 01:23:10,320
- I used to sneak out, too.
- Yeah?

1080
01:23:13,630 --> 01:23:18,976
And take a shower. You 
smell... Smell like garbage.

1081
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
I know.

1082
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:26,440
Peter, you're a good kid, 
and you're a smart kid.

1083
01:23:26,440 --> 01:23:28,440
So just try to keep your 
head straight, okay?

1084
01:23:29,320 --> 01:23:33,080
- Okay.
- Alright. Get out of here.

1085
01:23:40,680 --> 01:23:43,641
Are you expelled? Do you have to 
go to that high school on 46th,

1086
01:23:43,666 --> 01:23:47,840
- where the principal has a crossbow?
- Pretty sure that's an urban myth, but no, I'm not expelled.

1087
01:23:49,240 --> 01:23:51,240
You're so lucky.

1088
01:24:39,200 --> 01:24:41,886
- Hey.
- Hey.

1089
01:24:41,910 --> 01:24:43,960
I thought you had 
Calculus, fifth period.

1090
01:24:44,280 --> 01:24:46,400
Yeah, I'm just dipped 
on Homecoming stuff.

1091
01:24:46,950 --> 01:24:48,950
Hey, look. I, uhh...

1092
01:24:49,360 --> 01:24:53,160
- I just wanted to apologize about the whole decathlon thing.
- It's fine.

1093
01:24:53,560 --> 01:24:56,560
Last week, decathlon was 
the most important thing, but...

1094
01:24:56,720 --> 01:24:58,720
I almost died.

1095
01:24:59,990 --> 01:25:01,990
No. I ju--- I just mean that...

1096
01:25:02,160 --> 01:25:04,360
It was not cool, 
especially be...

1097
01:25:06,640 --> 01:25:08,640
Because...

1098
01:25:09,560 --> 01:25:11,880
... I like you.

1099
01:25:12,750 --> 01:25:14,750
I know.

1100
01:25:17,180 --> 01:25:20,880
- You do?
- You're terrible at keeping secrets.

1101
01:25:21,210 --> 01:25:23,210
Yeah, you'd be surprised.

1102
01:25:25,920 --> 01:25:28,200
I, I gotta get to class, but, umm...

1103
01:25:28,520 --> 01:25:32,160
I'd say we should hang out, but 
I'm gonna be in detention for a bit...

1104
01:25:33,080 --> 01:25:35,080
Ever... But, umm...

1105
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,560
I guess you already have 
a date for Homecoming.

1106
01:25:38,670 --> 01:25:40,850
Actually, I'm so busy planning it,

1107
01:25:40,850 --> 01:25:42,850
I never really got around to that part, so...

1108
01:25:44,720 --> 01:25:49,326
- You wanna, go with me?
- Yeah.

1109
01:25:49,350 --> 01:25:51,350
- Sure.
- Really?

1110
01:25:51,440 --> 01:25:53,440
I mean, uhh... Great. Cool.

1111
01:25:53,480 --> 01:25:57,960
- Cool.
- I'm actually, going that way.

1112
01:26:09,760 --> 01:26:11,760
May, I need your help!

1113
01:26:34,200 --> 01:26:36,200
Right?

1114
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:48,020
It's game day. So... 
What's the plan?

1115
01:26:48,280 --> 01:26:50,960
Open the door for her. 
Tell her she looks nice.

1116
01:26:50,960 --> 01:26:53,656
But not too much because 
that's creepy. No. And, uhh...

1117
01:26:53,680 --> 01:26:56,560
When I dance with her, I'll 
put my hands on her hips.

1118
01:26:56,680 --> 01:26:58,680
Your daffodils.

1119
01:27:00,640 --> 01:27:02,640
- Love you.
- Bye.

1120
01:27:16,640 --> 01:27:20,336
- You must be Peter.
- Yeah.

1121
01:27:20,360 --> 01:27:24,056
I'm Liz' Dad. Put her there.

1122
01:27:24,080 --> 01:27:27,910
Hell of a grip! Come 
on in here. Come on.

1123
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:53,600
Hi, Peter.

1124
01:27:53,760 --> 01:27:56,040
- You look very handsome.
- Thank you.

1125
01:27:56,880 --> 01:27:58,880
You got his name, right?

1126
01:27:58,880 --> 01:28:00,976
- Freddy?
- Peter.

1127
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:03,000
Peter. Peter.

1128
01:28:03,300 --> 01:28:06,510
- I'm gonna go get Liz.
- Okay.

1129
01:28:12,200 --> 01:28:14,640
- You all right, Pete?
- Yeah.

1130
01:28:15,040 --> 01:28:18,400
Because you 
look... pale.

1131
01:28:19,250 --> 01:28:23,200
You want something to drink, like a 
Bourbon, or Scotch, or something like that?

1132
01:28:23,320 --> 01:28:27,120
- I'm not old enough to drink.
- That's the right answer.

1133
01:28:29,220 --> 01:28:32,220
Wow! Wow, wow, wow, 
do you look beautiful.

1134
01:28:32,240 --> 01:28:35,256
- Please don't embarass me, Dad.
- Doesn't she, Pete?

1135
01:28:35,280 --> 01:28:37,560
Yeah, you look really good.

1136
01:28:38,160 --> 01:28:40,160
Once again, that's 
the right answer.

1137
01:28:40,310 --> 01:28:45,816
- Is that a corsage?
- Thanks.

1138
01:28:45,840 --> 01:28:49,530
Well, hey, I'm your chauffeur, so 
let's get this show on the road.

1139
01:28:49,540 --> 01:28:51,540
No, no, no. We have to 
take some pictures, Babe.

1140
01:28:52,720 --> 01:28:55,416
Right here. 
Perfect. Okay...

1141
01:28:55,440 --> 01:28:59,270
Come on, you guys. 
Peter, closer.

1142
01:29:00,690 --> 01:29:02,690
Smile!

1143
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,000
There you go.

1144
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:13,916
- Sir, you don't have to drive us..
- Nah. It's not a big deal.

1145
01:29:13,940 --> 01:29:16,030
I'm going out of town. 
It's right on my way.

1146
01:29:16,030 --> 01:29:18,280
- He's always coming and going.
- Last time, Babe.

1147
01:29:18,800 --> 01:29:21,800
- Thank you.
- I promise.

1148
01:29:22,950 --> 01:29:24,950
- See you in a couple of days.
- Okay.

1149
01:29:25,580 --> 01:29:27,616
Come on, Pedro.

1150
01:29:27,640 --> 01:29:29,720
- Bye, Peter. Have fun.
- Yeah, I will.

1151
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,836
- What are you gonna do, Pete?
- What?

1152
01:29:42,860 --> 01:29:44,896
When you graduate. What 
do you think you're gonna do?

1153
01:29:44,920 --> 01:29:48,296
- Oh. Umm, I don't know
- Don't grill him, Dad.

1154
01:29:48,320 --> 01:29:50,320
Just sayin'. 
You know.

1155
01:29:50,920 --> 01:29:54,800
While you guys are going to that school, 
you pretty much have your life planned out, right?

1156
01:29:55,360 --> 01:29:57,360
Yeah... No, I'm 
just a sophomore.

1157
01:29:57,640 --> 01:29:59,640
Peter has an internship 
with Tony Stark, so,

1158
01:29:59,810 --> 01:30:02,639
- I think he doesn't have to worry.
- Really?

1159
01:30:02,664 --> 01:30:05,120
- Stark?
- So cool.

1160
01:30:06,440 --> 01:30:08,440
What do you do?

1161
01:30:08,480 --> 01:30:11,200
Yeah, actually, I don't 
intern for him anymore.

1162
01:30:11,440 --> 01:30:14,136
- Seriously?
- Yeah. It got, umm...

1163
01:30:14,160 --> 01:30:16,856
- Boring.
- It was boring?

1164
01:30:16,880 --> 01:30:20,920
- You got to hang out with Spider-Man.
- Really? Spider-Man?

1165
01:30:21,360 --> 01:30:24,440
Wow. What's he like?

1166
01:30:24,730 --> 01:30:27,640
Yeah, he's nice. 
Nice man.

1167
01:30:28,430 --> 01:30:30,430
Solid dude.

1168
01:30:33,160 --> 01:30:35,400
- Look! So cute.
- Aww.

1169
01:30:40,520 --> 01:30:43,240
I've seen you around, 
right? I mean...

1170
01:30:43,660 --> 01:30:46,990
Somewhere. We've, uhh... Have 
we ever? Because even the voice...

1171
01:30:47,680 --> 01:30:49,680
He does academic 
decathlon, I think.

1172
01:30:50,160 --> 01:30:54,240
- And he was at my party.
- It was a great party! Really great, yeah.

1173
01:30:54,600 --> 01:30:56,960
Beautiful house. 
Lot of windows.

1174
01:30:57,210 --> 01:31:02,200
- You were there for like, 2 seconds.
- That was... I was there longer than 2 seconds.

1175
01:31:02,880 --> 01:31:06,200
- You disappeared.
- No. No, I did not disappear.

1176
01:31:06,660 --> 01:31:09,920
Yes, you did, you disappeared like 
you always do. Like you did in DC, too.

1177
01:31:18,360 --> 01:31:21,200
That was terrible, what happened 
down there in DC, though.

1178
01:31:21,640 --> 01:31:23,640
Were you scared?

1179
01:31:24,160 --> 01:31:28,760
I bet you were glad when your old pal 
Spider-Man showed up in the elevator though, huh?

1180
01:31:31,760 --> 01:31:33,760
Yeah, well, I... I 
actually didn't go up.

1181
01:31:33,880 --> 01:31:35,880
I saw it all 
from the ground.

1182
01:31:37,750 --> 01:31:39,800
Pretty lucky that he 
was there that day.

1183
01:31:43,360 --> 01:31:45,840
Good ol' Spider-Man.

1184
01:31:49,650 --> 01:31:51,650
Dad. The light.

1185
01:32:05,980 --> 01:32:08,076
Here we are.

1186
01:32:08,100 --> 01:32:10,100
- End of the line.
- Thanks, Dad.

1187
01:32:11,190 --> 01:32:15,880
You head in there, Gumdrop. I'm 
gonna give Peter the, "Dad talk".

1188
01:32:17,310 --> 01:32:19,336
Don't let him 
intimidate you.

1189
01:32:19,360 --> 01:32:22,159
- Love you.
- Love you, Gumdrop.

1190
01:32:22,184 --> 01:32:24,214
Have a safe flight.

1191
01:32:26,380 --> 01:32:28,380
You guys look so pretty!

1192
01:32:33,050 --> 01:32:36,776
- Does she know?
- Know what?

1193
01:32:36,800 --> 01:32:40,216
So she doesn't. Good. 
Close to the vest.

1194
01:32:40,240 --> 01:32:43,680
I admire that. I got a 
few secrets of my own.

1195
01:32:44,360 --> 01:32:47,440
Of all the reasons I didn't 
want my daughter to date...

1196
01:32:50,310 --> 01:32:54,380
Peter, nothing is more 
important than family.

1197
01:32:54,480 --> 01:32:58,260
You saved my daughter's life and I 
could never forget something like that.

1198
01:32:58,360 --> 01:33:01,400
So I'm gonna give you 
one chance. Are you ready?

1199
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:05,400
You walk through those doors, 
you forget any of this happened.

1200
01:33:05,460 --> 01:33:08,760
And don't you ever, ever...

1201
01:33:08,960 --> 01:33:11,360
Interfere with 
my business again.

1202
01:33:11,680 --> 01:33:13,680
Because if you do...

1203
01:33:13,840 --> 01:33:15,840
I'll kill you...

1204
01:33:16,410 --> 01:33:18,410
And everybody you love.

1205
01:33:19,150 --> 01:33:23,250
I'll kill you dead. That's what I
I'll do to protect my family, Pete.

1206
01:33:23,250 --> 01:33:25,250
You understand?

1207
01:33:28,100 --> 01:33:30,600
Hey. I just saved your life.

1208
01:33:30,880 --> 01:33:35,466
- Now, what do you say?
- Thank you.

1209
01:33:35,490 --> 01:33:37,490
You're welcome.

1210
01:33:37,580 --> 01:33:42,150
Now, you go in there, and you 
show my daughter a good time.

1211
01:33:42,150 --> 01:33:45,680
Okay? Just not too good.

1212
01:34:43,190 --> 01:34:45,190
What did he 
say to you?

1213
01:34:48,880 --> 01:34:50,880
I gotta go.

1214
01:34:52,130 --> 01:34:56,200
I'm sorry. You 
don't deserve this.

1215
01:35:17,460 --> 01:35:19,910
He gave you a choice. 
You chose wrong.

1216
01:35:19,935 --> 01:35:23,280
- What the hell?
- What's with the crappy costume?

1217
01:35:25,160 --> 01:35:27,160
My web shooters.

1218
01:35:35,680 --> 01:35:38,160
I wasn't sure about this 
thing at first, but...

1219
01:35:38,920 --> 01:35:40,920
Damn!

1220
01:35:45,400 --> 01:35:47,400
Gross!

1221
01:35:58,080 --> 01:36:01,770
- Why did he send you here?
- Guess you'll never know.

1222
01:36:05,910 --> 01:36:07,910
Nice shot!

1223
01:36:12,640 --> 01:36:15,620
Ned, the guy with 
the wings is Liz' Dad.

1224
01:36:15,680 --> 01:36:17,756
- What?
- I know. I gotta tell Mr. Stark.

1225
01:36:17,780 --> 01:36:20,376
Call Happy Hogan. He's 
Mr. Stark's head of security.

1226
01:36:20,400 --> 01:36:23,600
And get a computer and 
track my phone for me.

1227
01:36:23,780 --> 01:36:26,400
- Are you gonna be okay?
- Hurry, we gotta catch him before he leaves town!

1228
01:36:26,960 --> 01:36:28,960
I'm sorry about dinner, but...

1229
01:36:29,450 --> 01:36:32,140
I know when Branzino's fresh. 
And that was not fresh, okay?

1230
01:36:32,140 --> 01:36:34,156
So...

1231
01:36:34,180 --> 01:36:36,180
Flash, I need your 
car and your phone.

1232
01:36:36,360 --> 01:36:39,510
Sir, technically this is my 
dad's car, sir. So I can't---

1233
01:36:47,210 --> 01:36:50,976
- Hello, Ned? Hey, hey, hey. Can you hear me?
- Go for Ned.

1234
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:53,150
Ned. I need you to 
track my phone for me.

1235
01:36:53,180 --> 01:36:55,180
Yeah, but where is it?

1236
01:36:59,200 --> 01:37:01,520
Genius move. Okay, he just passed 
a Gamestop on Jackson Avenue.

1237
01:37:01,600 --> 01:37:04,780
Hey, where are the headlights 
on this thing? I'm in Flash's car.

1238
01:37:04,780 --> 01:37:07,190
- I'll pull the specs.
- Okay, you're on speaker phone.

1239
01:37:07,200 --> 01:37:09,320
You stole Flash's car? Awesome.

1240
01:37:09,345 --> 01:37:13,970
Yeah, it's awesome! Get outta 
the way, outta the way! Move!

1241
01:37:14,140 --> 01:37:16,216
- Peter, you okay?
- I've never really driven before.

1242
01:37:16,240 --> 01:37:19,460
Only in parking lots. 
This is a huge step up!

1243
01:37:21,770 --> 01:37:24,260
- Hey, have you gotten through to Happy yet?
- Yeah, I'm working on it.

1244
01:37:24,260 --> 01:37:26,260
I just gotta battle through 
the phone system.

1245
01:37:30,080 --> 01:37:32,080
Guy in the chair!

1246
01:37:36,610 --> 01:37:38,740
Takeoff in 9 minutes! Hello?

1247
01:37:38,740 --> 01:37:40,960
- Hello? Who is this?
- Mr. Happy, it's Ned.

1248
01:37:40,960 --> 01:37:43,006
- Who?
- I'm an associate of Peter Parker.

1249
01:37:43,030 --> 01:37:45,400
- He has something very important to tell you...
- You gotta be shitting me.

1250
01:37:46,730 --> 01:37:49,650
- Damn!
- Hey, Ned. How are we going on with those headlights?

1251
01:37:51,320 --> 01:37:53,580
Round knob, to the left 
of the steering wheel

1252
01:37:53,580 --> 01:37:55,606
- turn it clockwise.
- Left? Okay.

1253
01:37:55,630 --> 01:37:59,140
Okay, perfect. So where's 
my phone now?

1254
01:37:59,500 --> 01:38:02,560
- He stopped in an old industrial park in Brooklyn.
- What? That makes no sense.

1255
01:38:02,560 --> 01:38:06,376
- I thought he said he was going out of town.
- Weird. Oh, I reached Mr. Happy.

1256
01:38:06,400 --> 01:38:09,340
Don't think he likes you, by the 
way. It sounded like he was catching a flight.

1257
01:38:09,360 --> 01:38:11,600
- He said something about taking off in 9 minutes.
- What?

1258
01:38:11,600 --> 01:38:13,860
- He was surrounded by a bunch of boxes.
- Boxes?

1259
01:38:13,860 --> 01:38:15,860
It's moving day!

1260
01:38:15,940 --> 01:38:18,200
He's gonna rob that 
plane! I gotta stop him.

1261
01:38:21,880 --> 01:38:23,880
All right. Wheels 
up in 8 minutes.

1262
01:38:23,930 --> 01:38:26,680
We just gotta load Tony's 
old Hulkbuster armor,

1263
01:38:26,720 --> 01:38:28,720
prototype for 
Cap's new shield,

1264
01:38:28,800 --> 01:38:32,036
and the Megging... 
the Meg...

1265
01:38:32,060 --> 01:38:34,060
Thor's magic belt.

1266
01:38:34,560 --> 01:38:37,296
Okay, slow down. You're 
getting close. It's on your right.

1267
01:38:37,320 --> 01:38:39,320
- What?
- Turn right. Turn right!

1268
01:38:48,440 --> 01:38:50,786
- Peter! Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1269
01:38:50,810 --> 01:38:52,810
Just keep trying to 
get through to Happy.

1270
01:38:53,680 --> 01:38:55,680
It's been an honor, 
Spider-Man.

1271
01:38:56,260 --> 01:38:58,260
What are you doing here? 
There's a dance.

1272
01:39:02,520 --> 01:39:07,640
I'm... looking... at porn.

1273
01:39:48,030 --> 01:39:51,760
- Surprised?
- Oh, hey, Pete.

1274
01:39:52,360 --> 01:39:55,880
- I didn't hear you come in.
- It's over. I've got you.

1275
01:39:55,960 --> 01:39:58,566
Y'know, I gotta tell you, Pete...

1276
01:39:58,590 --> 01:40:01,140
I really, really 
admire your grit.

1277
01:40:03,020 --> 01:40:05,020
I see why Liz likes you.

1278
01:40:06,420 --> 01:40:09,607
I do. When you first came 
into the house, I wasn't sure.

1279
01:40:09,632 --> 01:40:12,456
I thought, "really?" 
But I get it now.

1280
01:40:12,480 --> 01:40:15,336
- How could you do this to her?
- To her?

1281
01:40:15,360 --> 01:40:18,920
I'm not doing anything to her, 
Pete. I'm doing this, for her.

1282
01:40:19,640 --> 01:40:21,640
Hmm. Yeah.

1283
01:40:24,300 --> 01:40:26,300
Peter.

1284
01:40:26,650 --> 01:40:30,510
You're young. You don't 
understand how the world works.

1285
01:40:30,510 --> 01:40:33,560
Yeah, but I understand that selling 
weapons to criminals is wrong.

1286
01:40:33,610 --> 01:40:36,140
How do you think your buddy 
Stark paid for that tower?

1287
01:40:36,200 --> 01:40:41,240
Or any of his little toys? Those people, 
Pete, those people up there, the rich and powerful...

1288
01:40:41,480 --> 01:40:44,066
They do whatever they 
want. Guys like us...

1289
01:40:44,090 --> 01:40:46,090
Like you and me...

1290
01:40:46,440 --> 01:40:49,456
They don't care about us. 
We build their roads,

1291
01:40:49,480 --> 01:40:53,140
and we fight all their wars and 
everything, but they don't care about us.

1292
01:40:53,200 --> 01:40:56,670
We have to pick up after them. 
We have to eat their table scraps.

1293
01:40:58,390 --> 01:41:00,390
That's how it is.

1294
01:41:01,310 --> 01:41:03,430
I know you know what 
I'm talking about, Peter.

1295
01:41:03,440 --> 01:41:05,440
Why are you 
telling me this?

1296
01:41:05,510 --> 01:41:07,570
Because I want 
you to understand.

1297
01:41:07,980 --> 01:41:12,140
And... I needed a little 
time to get her airborne.

1298
01:41:25,560 --> 01:41:27,560
I'm sorry, Peter.

1299
01:41:29,740 --> 01:41:33,030
What are you talking about? That 
thing hasn't even touched me yet.

1300
01:41:34,420 --> 01:41:36,420
True. But then again...

1301
01:41:36,620 --> 01:41:38,660
It wasn't really trying to.

1302
01:41:44,330 --> 01:41:46,500
- Chief, they're powering those engines. C'mon.
- Okay.

1303
01:41:46,590 --> 01:41:48,590
Yeah. Yeah.

1304
01:42:39,950 --> 01:42:41,950
Okay, ready?

1305
01:42:50,720 --> 01:42:52,720
Hello?!

1306
01:42:55,230 --> 01:42:58,490
Hello?! Please...

1307
01:42:58,490 --> 01:43:01,440
Hey, please... 
I'm down here!

1308
01:43:01,440 --> 01:43:04,060
I'm down here! I'm stuck. 
I'm stuck! I can't move...

1309
01:43:04,060 --> 01:43:06,060
I can't...

1310
01:43:22,420 --> 01:43:24,440
If you're nothing 
without this suit,

1311
01:43:24,560 --> 01:43:26,560
then you shouldn't have it.

1312
01:43:32,430 --> 01:43:36,296
Come on, Peter. 
Come on, Spider-Man.

1313
01:43:36,320 --> 01:43:38,416
Come on, Spider-Man.

1314
01:43:38,440 --> 01:43:40,440
Come on, Spider-Man.

1315
01:43:42,600 --> 01:43:44,600
Come on, Spider-Man!

1316
01:44:35,960 --> 01:44:37,960
Launch for intercept. 
Green light. Green light.

1317
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,000
Oh, yeah.

1318
01:44:54,360 --> 01:44:56,760
Retro-reflective 
panels engaged.

1319
01:45:08,860 --> 01:45:11,880
Got a visual on the plane, 
but feeling little resistance.

1320
01:45:11,900 --> 01:45:13,900
It's probably just drag 
on the new turbines.

1321
01:45:27,210 --> 01:45:29,560
Look out for the cloaking 
camera. Stay on the blindspots.

1322
01:45:39,710 --> 01:45:41,710
Oh, my God. 
Oh, my God.

1323
01:45:42,220 --> 01:45:44,570
Deploy high altitude 
vacuum seal.

1324
01:45:44,570 --> 01:45:46,570
This better work, Mason.

1325
01:45:51,720 --> 01:45:54,770
Trust me, boss. Even one of those 
boxes, and we are set for life.

1326
01:45:54,770 --> 01:45:56,770
Yeah.

1327
01:46:08,300 --> 01:46:11,360
You have 30 seconds to get to the 
cockpit and override their security.

1328
01:46:23,660 --> 01:46:27,140
- Cloning transponder signal.
- Launching decoy drone.

1329
01:46:31,090 --> 01:46:33,090
Entering new coordinates.

1330
01:46:38,520 --> 01:46:41,520
- Good. So it's on its way?
- Yes, sir. Right on course.

1331
01:46:41,520 --> 01:46:43,520
Okay. Thank you.

1332
01:46:44,030 --> 01:46:46,030
All right.

1333
01:46:57,960 --> 01:46:59,960
Hot dog.

1334
01:47:48,980 --> 01:47:51,056
Just a typical 
Homecoming...

1335
01:47:51,080 --> 01:47:53,200
on the outside 
of an invisible jet...

1336
01:47:54,160 --> 01:47:56,160
fighting my 
girlfriend's dad.

1337
01:48:05,520 --> 01:48:07,520
Oh, God!

1338
01:48:14,640 --> 01:48:16,640
I can't believe that worked!

1339
01:48:52,960 --> 01:48:55,180
Chief, Chief, you're losing 
altitude. Get outta there!

1340
01:48:55,280 --> 01:48:57,280
I'm not going home 
empty-handed.

1341
01:49:07,040 --> 01:49:09,040
Oh, my God!

1342
01:49:22,800 --> 01:49:24,816
Get out of there! 
What are you doing?!

1343
01:49:24,840 --> 01:49:26,840
Please turn, 
please turn!

1344
01:51:01,060 --> 01:51:03,060
Hey, Pedro.

1345
01:51:50,070 --> 01:51:52,070
Bingo.

1346
01:52:07,360 --> 01:52:10,800
Your wings... Your 
wings are gonna explode!

1347
01:52:18,680 --> 01:52:22,240
- Time to go home, Pete!
- I'm trying to save you!

1348
01:52:39,120 --> 01:52:41,120
No.

1349
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:23,660
You looked so insane. The 
whole... Like, it was just crazy!

1350
01:54:23,750 --> 01:54:26,040
He was just like...

1351
01:54:26,200 --> 01:54:28,200
And you were like...

1352
01:54:28,360 --> 01:54:30,360
And then I just hit 
him with the...

1353
01:54:30,470 --> 01:54:32,470
It was so... 
Oh, my God.

1354
01:54:32,560 --> 01:54:36,560
And you saved me. 
Awesome.

1355
01:54:42,240 --> 01:54:44,240
Hey, Liz!

1356
01:54:45,450 --> 01:54:47,450
I'm gonna miss you.

1357
01:54:49,460 --> 01:54:51,460
Liz.

1358
01:54:57,480 --> 01:54:59,480
Liz, look, I'm so sorry.

1359
01:55:00,040 --> 01:55:02,560
You say that a lot. What 
are you sorry for this time?

1360
01:55:04,410 --> 01:55:06,410
The dance?

1361
01:55:06,510 --> 01:55:09,680
That, was a pretty 
crappy thing to do.

1362
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:13,440
Yeah, but... Your Dad. I can't 
imagine what you're going through.

1363
01:55:14,090 --> 01:55:16,090
If there's anything 
I can do to help...

1364
01:55:16,290 --> 01:55:18,650
I guess we're 
moving to Oregon.

1365
01:55:19,040 --> 01:55:21,080
Mom says it's nice 
there, so that's cool.

1366
01:55:21,480 --> 01:55:24,590
Anyways,

1367
01:55:24,590 --> 01:55:26,840
Dad doesn't want us 
here during the trial, so...

1368
01:55:28,880 --> 01:55:30,880
Liz, I... I...

1369
01:55:31,640 --> 01:55:33,640
Bye, Peter.

1370
01:55:34,150 --> 01:55:37,640
Whatever's going on with 
you, I hope you figure it out.

1371
01:55:50,120 --> 01:55:54,230
Congratulations, decathlon 
national champions!

1372
01:55:56,380 --> 01:55:58,725
I'm gonna have to put this back 
in the trophy case soon, but,

1373
01:55:58,750 --> 01:56:01,144
just for motivation right 
now, at this practice.

1374
01:56:01,230 --> 01:56:04,800
I'm a little ahead of the game, but 
we will need a new team captain next year.

1375
01:56:04,840 --> 01:56:08,580
So I am appointing Michelle.

1376
01:56:12,350 --> 01:56:15,590
Thank you. My 
friends call me "MJ."

1377
01:56:15,990 --> 01:56:17,990
I thought you didn't 
have any friends.

1378
01:56:18,220 --> 01:56:20,220
I didn't.

1379
01:56:24,600 --> 01:56:27,850
- I gotta go.
- Hey, where're you going?

1380
01:56:29,370 --> 01:56:31,710
What are you 
hiding, Peter?

1381
01:56:33,580 --> 01:56:35,636
I'm just kidding. 
I don't care. Bye.

1382
01:56:35,660 --> 01:56:37,760
Alright. So, we should 
run some drills.

1383
01:56:46,870 --> 01:56:50,270
Hey, Happy. What 
are you doing here?

1384
01:56:51,090 --> 01:56:53,090
I really owe you one.

1385
01:56:54,230 --> 01:56:56,600
I don't know what I would 
do without this job.

1386
01:56:56,880 --> 01:56:58,880
I mean, before 
I met Tony...

1387
01:57:28,540 --> 01:57:30,560
So, how long have 
you been here?

1388
01:57:30,580 --> 01:57:32,590
Long enough to be awkward. 
Boss wants to see you.

1389
01:57:32,590 --> 01:57:34,656
Is he here, too?

1390
01:57:34,680 --> 01:57:36,680
In the toilet?
No. He's upstate.

1391
01:57:36,700 --> 01:57:38,756
Upstate? Like 
upstate, upstate?

1392
01:57:38,780 --> 01:57:40,281
Yeah. Let's go.

1393
01:57:41,620 --> 01:57:44,930
Take a look. It's pretty 
impressive, huh?

1394
01:57:45,580 --> 01:57:47,720
They just finished remodelling 
the whole thing.

1395
01:58:14,700 --> 01:58:16,840
- You don't see that everyday.
- Oh, there they are.

1396
01:58:18,740 --> 01:58:21,140
- How was the ride out?
- Good.

1397
01:58:21,150 --> 01:58:23,150
Give me a minute 
with the kid.

1398
01:58:24,020 --> 01:58:26,020
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

1399
01:58:26,200 --> 01:58:29,290
- I gotta talk to the kid.
- I'll be close behind.

1400
01:58:29,290 --> 01:58:32,870
How about a loose follow, 
alright? Boundaries are good.

1401
01:58:38,340 --> 01:58:41,066
Sorry I took your suit. 
I mean, you had it coming.

1402
01:58:41,090 --> 01:58:44,500
Actually, it turns out, it was the perfect, sort 
of tough love moment that you needed, right?

1403
01:58:44,600 --> 01:58:47,356
To urge you on, right? Wouldn't 
you think? Don't you think?

1404
01:58:47,380 --> 01:58:49,380
Let's just say it was.

1405
01:58:51,220 --> 01:58:54,440
- Mr. Stark, I really...
- You screwed the pooch hard, big-time.

1406
01:58:54,490 --> 01:58:56,576
But then, you 
did the right thing.

1407
01:58:56,600 --> 01:58:58,630
You took the dog to 
the free clinic, you...

1408
01:58:58,630 --> 01:59:02,260
Raised the hybrid puppies...
All right, not my best analogy.

1409
01:59:03,180 --> 01:59:05,180
I was wrong 
about you.

1410
01:59:05,780 --> 01:59:07,780
I think with a little 
more mentoring...

1411
01:59:08,170 --> 01:59:10,170
You could be a real 
asset to the team.

1412
01:59:11,740 --> 01:59:13,776
- To the team?
- Yeah. Anyway...

1413
01:59:13,800 --> 01:59:15,820
There's about 50 
reporters behind that door.

1414
01:59:15,820 --> 01:59:17,916
Real ones, not bloggers.

1415
01:59:17,940 --> 01:59:22,036
When you're ready...
I want you to try that on.

1416
01:59:22,060 --> 01:59:26,060
And I'll introduce the world to the 
newest official member of the Avengers:

1417
01:59:26,140 --> 01:59:28,140
Spider-Man.

1418
01:59:33,580 --> 01:59:35,580
Yeah. Give that a lick.

1419
01:59:41,300 --> 01:59:44,460
So, after the press conference, Happy 
will show you to your room, your new quarters.

1420
01:59:44,860 --> 01:59:48,810
- Where's he between? He's next to Vision?
- Yeah, Vision's not big on doors.

1421
01:59:50,730 --> 01:59:52,730
- Or walls.
- He'll fit right in.

1422
01:59:59,280 --> 02:00:01,280
Thank you, Mr. Stark.

1423
02:00:01,800 --> 02:00:03,800
But, I... I'm good.

1424
02:00:03,960 --> 02:00:06,500
You're good? Good, 
how are you good?

1425
02:00:06,860 --> 02:00:11,020
I mean, I'd rather just stay on 
the ground, for a little while.

1426
02:00:11,130 --> 02:00:13,130
Friendly, neighborhood 
Spider-Man.

1427
02:00:13,410 --> 02:00:15,540
Somebody's gotta stick 
out for the little guy, right?

1428
02:00:15,940 --> 02:00:19,380
Are you turning me down? You 
better think about this. Look at that.

1429
02:00:19,620 --> 02:00:22,196
Look at me. Last 
chance: Yes or No?

1430
02:00:22,220 --> 02:00:24,236
- No.
- Okay.

1431
02:00:24,260 --> 02:00:27,460
It's kind of a Springsteeny, 
working class hero, vibe of the day.

1432
02:00:27,480 --> 02:00:29,620
Happy will take you home.

1433
02:00:29,620 --> 02:00:31,716
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1434
02:00:31,740 --> 02:00:35,100
You mind waiting in the 
car? I need a minute.

1435
02:00:35,540 --> 02:00:38,436
- Thank you, Mr. Stark.
- Yes, Mr. Parker. You're very welcome.

1436
02:00:38,460 --> 02:00:40,460
See you around.

1437
02:00:48,520 --> 02:00:51,685
That was a test, right? 
There's nobody back there?

1438
02:00:51,710 --> 02:00:55,120
Yes. You passed. All right, 
skedaddle there, young buck.

1439
02:00:55,120 --> 02:00:58,780
- Thank you, Mr. Stark. Thank you!
- Yeah. Thank you!

1440
02:01:00,300 --> 02:01:02,300
Told you he's a good kid.

1441
02:01:08,290 --> 02:01:10,296
- Where's the kid?
- He left.

1442
02:01:10,321 --> 02:01:13,170
- Everybody's waiting.
- You know what, he actually made a really mature choice.

1443
02:01:13,170 --> 02:01:16,370
- He just surprised the heck out of us.
- Did you guys screw this up?

1444
02:01:16,370 --> 02:01:19,076
- He told the kid to go wait in the car.
- Are you kidding me?

1445
02:01:19,100 --> 02:01:21,940
I have a room full of people in there, waiting for some big announcement.

1446
02:01:22,020 --> 02:01:25,460
- What am I gonna tell them?
- Think of something. How about...

1447
02:01:26,060 --> 02:01:28,500
- Happy, do you still got that ring?
- Do I...

1448
02:01:28,500 --> 02:01:32,220
- The engagement ring.
- Are you kidding? I've been carrying this since 2008.

1449
02:01:35,780 --> 02:01:38,816
- Okay.
- I think I can think of something better than that.

1450
02:01:38,840 --> 02:01:40,840
Buy us a little time.

1451
02:01:42,340 --> 02:01:44,340
Like we need time.

1452
02:01:44,660 --> 02:01:47,761
- I can't believe you have that thing in your pocket.
- Can I get the door for you, Hon?

1453
02:01:47,786 --> 02:01:49,864
Alright.

1454
02:02:05,100 --> 02:02:07,100
Hey, May, did you 
get dinner already?

1455
02:02:17,900 --> 02:02:19,900
May?

1456
02:02:40,050 --> 02:02:42,050
What the fu---
