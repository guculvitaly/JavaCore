80
00:05:20,498 --> 00:05:23,456
The granaries are being emptied
and loaded into wagons, my lord.

81
00:05:23,456 --> 00:05:26,289
- The current harvest?
- We have teams of men collecting it

82
00:05:26,289 --> 00:05:27,956
from all the farms
in the Reach.

83
00:05:27,956 --> 00:05:30,289
Ser Bronn, will you
accompany the Tarlys

84
00:05:30,289 --> 00:05:32,456
and help them
accelerate this process?

85
00:05:32,456 --> 00:05:34,456
I'm not much
for shoveling wheat.

86
00:05:34,456 --> 00:05:39,622
No, but motivating reluctant farmers to
hand over their harvest--

87
00:05:39,622 --> 00:05:41,664

a real talent for that.

I always considered your father
a very effective and efficient man,

94

96
00:06:17,539 --> 00:06:20,705
I am neither kind
nor a lord, Your Grace.

97
00:06:20,705 --> 00:06:23,872
I am merely an instrument
of the institution I represent.

98
00:06:23,872 --> 00:06:27,622
Its well-being is a matter
of arithmetic, not sentiment.

99
00:06:27,622 --> 00:06:30,705
And the current arithmetic
is outstanding.

100
00:06:31,914 --> 00:06:33,997
- Uh, the gold...
- Is on its way.

101
00:06:33,997 --> 00:06:37,997
My brother is supervising
its transportation himself.

102
00:06:37,997 --> 00:06:40,914
Some at the Iron Bank
will be disappointed.

103
00:06:40,914 --> 00:06:43,664
They've grown rather fond
of your interest payments.

104
00:06:43,664 --> 00:06:46,914
We must devise a way
to raise their spirits.

105
00:06:46,914 --> 00:06:49,373
Yes, perhaps we could
be of assistance

106
00:06:49,373 --> 00:06:52,164
in some
current venture.

107
00:06:52,164 --> 00:06:54,122
My only venture
at this moment

108
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:56,789
is reestablishing control
over this continent

109
00:06:56,789 --> 00:06:59,081
and every person on it.

110
00:06:59,081 --> 00:07:01,914
I see a great deal
of potential in that venture.

111
00:07:01,914 --> 00:07:05,872
I imagine it would require
outside investment.

112
00:07:05,872 --> 00:07:07,122
It will, indeed.

113
00:07:07,122 --> 00:07:10,081
I need to expand
my armies, my navies.

114
00:07:10,081 --> 00:07:13,789
My Hand, Qyburn, has made overtures to
the Golden Company in Essos.

115
00:07:13,789 --> 00:07:14,997
I know them well.

116
00:07:14,997 --> 00:07:17,456
They have helped us
recover significant sums

117
00:07:17,456 --> 00:07:20,414
from parties who had
fallen into deep arrears.

118
00:07:20,414 --> 00:07:22,122
That's good to hear.

119
00:07:22,122 --> 00:07:25,539

some things that belong to me.

That very question was

In a way, that dagger made you

- You will stay.

- You still have the largest armies.
- Who won't be able to eat

351

We don't have
marriage in Naath,

of a bastard doesn't exist.
